[ 3 ] [ 4 ] GDP is often used to measure the economic activity of a country or region. [ 2 ] The major components of GDP are consumption, government spending, net exports (exports minus imports), and investment. Changing any of these factors can increase the size of the economy. For example, population growth through mass immigration can raise consumption and demand for public services, thereby contributing to GDP growth. However, GDP is not a measure of overall standard of living or well-being, as it does not account for how income is distributed among the population. A country may rank high in GDP but still experience jobless growth depending on its planned economic structure and strategies. Dividing total GDP by the population gives an idealized rough measure of GDP per capita . [ 5 ] [ 3 ] Several national and international economic organizations, such as the OECD and the International Monetary Fund , maintain their own definitions of GDP. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] GDP is often used as a metric for international comparisons as well as a broad measure of economic progress . It serves as a statistical indicator of national development and progress. Total GDP can also be broken down into the contribution of each industry or sector of the economy. [ 8 ] Nominal GDP is useful when comparing national economies on the international market using current exchange rate . [ 9 ] To compare economies over time inflation can be adjusted by comparing real instead of nominal values . For cross-country comparisons, GDP figures are often adjusted for differences in the cost of living using purchasing power parity (PPP). GDP per capita at purchasing power parity can be useful for comparing living standards between nations. GDP has been criticized for leaving out key externalities , such as resource extraction , [ clarification needed ] environmental impact and unpaid domestic work . [ 10 ] Alternative economic indicators such as doughnut economics use other measures, such as the Human Development Index or Better Life Index , as better approaches to measuring the effect of the economy on human development and well being . Sir William Petty came up with a concept of GDP, to calculate the tax burden , and argue landlords were unfairly taxed during warfare between the Dutch and the English between 1652 and 1674. [ 11 ] Charles Davenant developed the method further in 1695. [ 12 ] The modern concept of GDP was first developed by Simon Kuznets for a 1934 U.S. Congress report, where he warned against its use as a measure of welfare (see below under limitations and criticisms ). [ 13 ] After the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944, GDP became the main tool for measuring a country's economy. [ 14 ] At that time gross national product (GNP) was the preferred estimate, which diffe",

Our GDPNow forecasting model provides a \"nowcast\" of the official estimate prior to its release by estimating GDP growth using a methodology similar to the one used by the US Bureau of Economic Analysis. GDPNow is not an official forecast of the Atlanta Fed. Rather, it is best viewed as a running estimate of real GDP growth based on available economic data for the current measured quarter. There are no subjective adjustments made to GDPNow—the estimate is based solely on the mathematical results of the model. Recent forecasts for the GDPNow model are available here . More extensive numerical details—including underlying source data, forecasts, and model parameters—are available as a separate spreadsheet . You can also view an archive of recent commentaries from GDPNow estimates. Please note that we no longer support the GDPNow app . Download our EconomyNow app to get the latest GDP nowcast and more economic data. Latest estimate: 3.8 percent — October 07, 2025 The GDPNow model estimate for real GDP growth (seasonally adjusted annual rate) in the third quarter of 2025 is 3.8 percent on October 7, unchanged from October 1 after rounding. Due to the government shutdown, today’s GDPNow update is based only on the Nonmanufacturing ISM Report on Business released on October 3 by the Institute for Supply Management. After that release, the nowcast of third-quarter real gross private domestic investment growth decreased from 4.2 percent to 4.0 percent. Due to the government shutdown, the GDPNow update scheduled for Thursday, October 9, will be deferred until a new monthly data release is available for the model. In this video economist Pat Higgins, GDPNow's creator, discusses the difference between nowcasting and forecasting. The growth rate of real gross domestic product (GDP) measured by the US Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) is a key metric of the pace of economic activity. It is one of the four variables included in the economic projections of Federal Reserve Board members and Bank presidents for every other Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. As with many economic statistics, GDP estimates are released with a lag whose timing can be important for policymakers. In preparation for FOMC meetings, policymakers have the Fed Board staff projection of this “advance” estimate at their disposal. These projections—available through 2008 at the Philadelphia Fed’s Real Time Data Center —have generally been more accurate than forecasts from simple statistical models. As stated by economists Jon Faust and Jonathan H. Wright in a 2009 paper , “by mirroring key elements of the data construction machinery of the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the Fed staff forms a relatively precise estimate of what BEA will announce for the previous quarter’s GDP even before it is announced.” The Atlanta Fed GDPNow model also mi",

      "text": "Economists typically frame the impact of fiscal, monetary, and tax policies by talking about three main economic indicators: GDP, jobs, and wages. It’s easy to understand why jobs and wages are important if you have a job and earn income: fewer jobs could put yours at risk or make a job search more difficult, and reduced wages mean less money in your wallet. But GDP? That metric is more abstract. GDP stands for gross domestic product and is a measure of how well a country’s economy is doing—a health check of sorts. It represents all the goods and services produced within a country, usually over one year. GDP is calculated by measuring a country’s total consumption (buying of goods and services), government spending, investments, and net exports (the difference between the money a country earns selling to other countries and the money it spends buying from other countries). This measure also takes into account the size of the economy, population, and even inflation Inflation is when the general price of goods and services increases across the economy, reducing the purchasing power of a currency and the value of certain assets. The same paycheck covers less goods, services, and bills. It is sometimes referred to as a “hidden tax,” as it leaves taxpayers less well-off due to higher costs and “bracket creep,” while increasing the government’s spendin . On the surface, this may seem irrelevant to you, the consumer and taxpayer, as you make purchases, save money, earn money, and make investments. But the state of gross domestic product can actually impact you directly. When economists and lawmakers talk about a policy’s effect on GDP, it’s easy to ignore it as a political talking point. In reality, they are trying to convey the real-world effects of proposed or existing legislation. At the most basic level, GDP, GDP per capita, and change in GDP (typically expressed as GDP growth) are ways to estimate the standard of living in a country. If GDP is growing steadily, that likely means that wages are growing, more jobs are available, and things are becoming more affordable. Gross domestic product is not a perfect measure of living standards or the overall economy. Since a lot goes into the measurement of GDP, an increase does not always mean that the financial circumstances of everyone in the economy are improving. Nonetheless, it is the most effective metric available to gauge the status of the economy. Subscribe to get insights from our trusted experts delivered straight to your inbox.

Several major new tax breaks are scheduled to expire at the end of 2028, setting the stage for another tax fight to either extend them or allow them to expire.
