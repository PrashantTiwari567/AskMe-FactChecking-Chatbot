That would be alchemy, which does not exist. Au is the elemental abbreviation for gold. The third symbol to get to the last pure metal, which is usually considered to be gold (Au), is the chemical symbol for silver (Ag). In the context of the periodic table, the transition metals lead to gold, with silver being one of the key metals preceding it. Therefore, the sequence of symbols would typically involve copper (Cu), silver (Ag), and then gold (Au). The chemical symbol for gold is 'Au' . This comes from Latin for gold, which is 'Aurum'. Similarly, Silver is 'Ag'. Again from Latin, for silver which is 'Argentum'.
