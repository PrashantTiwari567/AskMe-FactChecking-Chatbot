[ 17 ] [ 18 ] However, Congress has never passed a bill to designate English as the official language of all three federal branches. English is designated official in 32 of 50 states (and in all five U.S. territories ). Hawaiian is official in Hawaii , 20 Native languages are official in Alaska , and Sioux is official in South Dakota . [ 19 ] Samoan is an official language in American Samoa , [ 20 ] Chamorro is an official language in Guam , [ 21 ] Chamorro and Carolinian are official languages in the Northern Mariana Islands , [ 22 ] and Spanish is an official language in Puerto Rico . [ 23 ] The United States is the most populous country in the Americas and the Western Hemisphere , with a projected population of 342,034,432 on July 1, 2025, according to the U.S. Census Bureau . [ 1 ] With about 4% of the world's population, it is the third most populous country . The U.S. population grew 2.6% between the 2020 federal census of 331,449,281 residents and the 2024 official annual estimate of 340,110,998. [ 2 ] These figures include the 50 states and the federal capital, Washington, D.C. , but exclude the 3.6 million residents of five unincorporated U.S. territories ( Puerto Rico , Guam , the U.S. Virgin Islands , American Samoa , and the Northern Mariana Islands ) as well as several minor uninhabited island possessions . The Census Bureau showed a population increase of 0.98% for the twelve-month period ending in July 2024, [ 3 ] slightly below the world estimated annual growth rate of 1.03%. [ 25 ] By several metrics, including racial and ethnic background, religious affiliation, and percentage of rural and urban divide, the state of Illinois is the most representative of the larger demography of the United States. [ 26 ] The United States population almost quadrupled during the 20th century—at a growth rate of about 1.3% a year—from about 76 million in 1900 to 281 million in 2000. [ 27 ] It is estimated to have reached the 200 million mark in 1967, and the 300 million mark on October 17, 2006. [ 27 ] [ 28 ] Foreign-born immigration caused the U.S. population to continue its rapid increase, with this population doubling from almost 20 million in 1990 to over 45 million in 2015, [ 29 ] representing one-third of the population increase. [ 30 ] The U.S. Census Bureau reported in late 2024 that recent immigration to the United States had more than offset the country's lower birth and fertility rates: \"Net international migration’s influence on population trends has increased over the last few years. Since 2021, it accounted for the majority of the nation’s growth—a departure from the last two decades, when natural increase was the main factor.\" This in turn led to a notable increase in the U.S. population in each of the years 2022, 2023, and 2024 (+0.58%, +0.83%, and +0.98%, respectively).

The Population of United States (1950 - 2025) chart plots the total population count as of July 1 of each year, from 1950 to 2025. The Yearly Population Growth Rate chart plots the annual percentage changes in population registered on July 1 of each year, from 1951 to 2025. This value can differ from the Yearly % Change shown in the historical table, which shows the last year equivalent percentage change assuming homogeneous change in the preceding five year period. Year : as of July 1 of the year indicated. Population : Overall total population (both sexes and all ages) in the country as of July 1 of the year indicated, as estimated by the United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division. World Population Prospects: The 2024 Revision . For forecasted years, the U.N. medium-fertility variant is used. Yearly % Change : For 2025: percentage change in total population over the last year (from July 1, 2024 to June 30, 2025). For all other years: latest year annual percentage change equivalent assuming homogeneous change in the preceding five year period, calculated through reverse compounding. Yearly Change : For 2025: absolute change in total population (increase or decrease in number of people) over the last year (from July 1, 2024 to June 30, 2025). For all other years: average annual numerical change over the preceding five year period. Migrants (net) : The average annual number of immigrants minus the number of emigrants over the preceding five year period (running from July 1 to June 30 of the initial and final years), or subsequent five year period (for 2016 data). A negative number means that there are more emigrants than immigrants. Median Age : age that divides the population into two numerically equal groups: half of the people are older than the median age indicated and half are younger. This parameter provides an indication of age distribution. Fertility Rate : (Total Fertility Rate, or TFR), it is expressed as children per woman. It is calculated as the average number of children an average wom",
