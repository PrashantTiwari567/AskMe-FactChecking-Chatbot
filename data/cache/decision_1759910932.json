The ocean is conventionally divided into large bodies of water, which are also referred to as oceans, and are themselves mostly divided into seas, gulfs and subsequent bodies of water. The ocean contains 97% of Earth's water and is the primary component of Earth's hydrosphere, acting as a huge reservoir of heat for Earth's energy budget, as well as for its carbon cycle and water cycle, forming the basis for climate and weather patterns worldwide. The ocean is essential to life on Earth, harbouring most of Earth's animals and protist life, originating photosynthesis and therefore Earth's atmospheric oxygen, still supplying half of it.",

From the Arctic to the Southern, the five ocean basins are home to thousands of marine life and millions of square miles of water. The smallest ocean basin on Earth is the Arctic Ocean, which has an area of approximately 6.1 million square miles , according to the National Ocean Service. But what about the largest? Here is what you need to know about the largest ocean, plus other facts about the deep blue sea. The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's ocean basins, according to the National Ocean Service. It contains more than half of the free water on Earth, spanning around 63 million square miles . Additionally, the Pacific is the oldest of the existing ocean basins with its oldest rocks dating back to 200 million years ago. The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest ocean basin on Earth, covering an area of around 41 million square miles , according to National Ocean Service. This ocean basin makes up 20% of the Earth’s surface. The Atlantic Ocean connects to the Arctic Ocean and the Southern Ocean, also known as the Antarctic Ocean, according to the National Ocean Service. Here are the five ocean basins from largest to smallest, based on area, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .",

Published by Dr. Rabiah Ryklief Principal Scientist and Lecturer of Marine Science, with a PhD in Zoology Explore the depths of our article and read our expert's opinion at the end On this list, readers can discover the ten largest oceans and seas . From the colossal Pacific Ocean , spanning an 63.8 million square miles, to the historic Mediterranean Sea , covering 970 thousand square miles. These vast bodies of water not only cover significant portions of our plane t but also include ocean basins. They are home to critical trade routes , shipping ports , and a wide variety of ecosystems and marine life . Location: Spans from the Arctic in the north to the Southern in the south. Area: 63.8 million square miles (165.2 million square kilometers). Max depth: Over 6.8 miles (11 kilometers) in the Marianna Trench. Fun fact: It was named by the explorer Ferdinand Magellan who chose “pacific” to mean “peaceful sea.” The Pacific is the largest ocean in the world, making up around 30% of the world’s surface area and almost double that in water surface area. It is home to the deepest trench on earth , the Mariana Trench , where the Challenger Deep is located . The trench is located between two tectonic plates , accounting for its incredible depth and is prone to earthquakes . Its vast basin is also home to some of the oldest rocks on Earth, marking it as a crucial part of our planet’s geological history. For example the Ring of Fire , a chain of 450 volcanoes and earthquake sites, is arranged in a U-shape along the edges of the Pacific. Today, the Pacific is home to the Great Pacific Garbage Patch , a massive collection of marine debris. This garbage patch isn’t a single entity, but rather two distinct collections of debris held together by the powerful currents of the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. Location: Between the Americas to the west and Europe and Africa to the east. Area: 41.1 million square miles (106.5 million square kilometers). Max depth: Over 5.3 miles (8,6 kilometers) in the Puerto Rico Trench. Fun fact: The Atlantic is growing wider over time due to sea-floor spreading. The Atlantic is the second-largest ocean in the world and covers around 20% of the Earth’s surface . It is thought to have formed during the Jurassic Period . Within the Atlantic are the Sargasso, Caribbean and Mediterranean Seas . The Atlantic is often split into two basins : the North and South Atlantic. In the North Atlantic, cold Arctic waters sink, initiating the “ global ocean conveyor “, a key climate-regulating current. The world’s largest island, Greenland, is also located within the North Atlantic. The Atlantic is a vital resource, providing a significant portion of the world’s fish and housing valuable mineral deposits, as well as oil, gas and coal. Additionally, it serves as a major shipping route for global trade. Location: Bordered by Africa to the west, Asia to t",

They span over massive distances, separating our continents and playing key parts in the world’s ecosystems and planetary climate. Since the early days of mankind, the seas have also been central to our survival by offering us food and the means of greater exploration. By now, you’re probably wondering just how huge the Earth’s oceans can get. Today we’ll look at 10 of the largest oceans and seas in the world and learn about what sets them apart. Source: wikimedia.org Almost entirely surrounded by North American land, the Gulf of Mexico is separated from the Caribbean Sea by the Yucatan Channel . The Gulf Stream, a warm and powerful current, is one of the strongest known currents in the world . It’s fed by the Carbibbean Current and the Antilles Current, and its warm waters are a breeding ground for storms. Sigsbee Deep or the “Grand Canyon under the sea” is the deepest point in the Gulf of Mexico and reaches a depth of 14,383 feet . Source: wikimedia.org This huge sea flows through the Bering Strait to connect with the Arctic Ocean , passing through the oceanic territory of both Russia and the United States. Sadly, the fur seal population of the Bering Sea was aggressively hunted for their pelts, resulting in the Bering Sea Fur-Seal Controversy of 1886 . The Bering Sea is said to be extremely biologically prolific , sustaining several fisheries and supporting a wide range of wildlife. Source: wikimedia.org This South China Sea connects to the neighboring East China Sea through the Taiwan Strait , with its China Sea Basin reaching an astounding maximum depth of 16,457 feet . One entire third of the world’s shipping passes through the South China Sea, making it an extremely important economic and political factor in world trade. The bustling South China Sea is the center of various territorial disputes resulting from several Asian countries making overlapping territorial claims. Source: wikimedia.org While it hosts over 7,000 different islands belonging to more than 28 different nations, the Caribbean Sea is possibly even more renowned for containing one of the deepest points on Earth: the Cayman Trench. Located between Cuba and Jamaica, the Cayman Trench or “Bartlett Deep” reaches a staggering depth of 25,216 feet below sea level . The entire area of the Caribbean in combination with its many islands and the Gulf of Mexico is referred to as the Wider Caribbean . Source: wikimedia.org The sunny climate and warm waters of the Mediterranean are home to a wide variety of birds and around 400 different species of fish . This sizeable body of water would be landlocked if it weren’t for the Strait of Gibraltar, which flows between Morocco and Spain to the Atlantic Ocean. Its geographical location and abundant natural resources have made the Mediterranean Sea an important trading center and source of political conflicts throughout history ",
