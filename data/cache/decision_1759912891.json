      "text": "Mount Everest (known locally as Sagarmāthā [ a ] in Nepal and Qomolangma [ b ] in Tibet ) is Earth's highest mountain above sea level . It lies in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas and marks part of the China–Nepal border at its summit. [ 4 ] Its height was most recently measured in 2020 by Chinese and Nepali authorities as 8,848.86 m (29,031 ft 8 + 1 ⁄ 2 in). [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Mount Everest attracts many climbers, including highly experienced mountaineers. There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal (known as the standard route) and the other from the north in Tibet . While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route, Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness , weather, and wind, as well as hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall . As of May 2024, 340 people have died on Everest . Over 200 bodies remain on the mountain and have not been removed due to the dangerous conditions. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Climbers typically ascend only part of Mount Everest's elevation, as the mountain's full elevation is measured from the geoid , which approximates sea level . The closest sea to Mount Everest's summit is the Bay of Bengal , almost 700 km (430 mi) away. To approximate a climb of the entire height of Mount Everest, one would need to start from this coastline, a feat accomplished by Tim Macartney-Snape's team in 1990. Climbers usually begin their ascent from base camps above 5,000 m (16,404 ft). The amount of elevation climbed from below these camps varies. On the Tibetan side, most climbers drive directly to the North Base Camp . On the Nepalese side, climbers generally fly into Kathmandu , then Lukla , and trek to the South Base Camp , making the climb from Lukla to the summit about 6,000 m (20,000 ft) in elevation gain. The first recorded efforts to reach Everest's summit were made by British mountaineers . As Nepal did not allow foreigners to enter the country at the time, the British made several attempts on the North Ridge route from the Tibetan side. After the first reconnaissance expedition by the British in 1921 reached 7,000 m (22,966 ft) on the North Col , the 1922 expedition on its first summit attempt marked the first time a human had climbed above 8,000 m (26,247 ft) and it also pushed the North Ridge route up to 8,321 m (27,300 ft). On the 1924 expedition George Mallory and Andrew Irvine made a final summit attempt on 8 June but never returned, sparking debate as to whether they were the first to reach the top. Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary made the first documented ascent of Everest in 1953 , using the Southeast Ridge route. Norgay had reached 8,595 m (28,199 ft) the previous year as a member of the 1952 Swiss expedition . The Chinese mountaineering team of Wang Fuzhou , Gonpo , and Qu Yinhua made the first reported ascent of the peak from the North Ridge on 25 May 1960.

There is disagreement over the exact elevation of Mount Everest because of variations in snow level, gravity deviation, and light refraction, among other factors. However, in 2020 China and Nepal jointly declared Mount Everest’s elevation to be 29,031.69 feet (8,848.86 metres), which was subsequently widely accepted. Reinhold Messner completed the first solo ascent of Mount Everest in 1980. Mount Everest is on the crest of the Great Himalayas of southern Asia. It lies on the border between Nepal and the Tibet Autonomous Region of China. The first woman to summit Everest was the Japanese climber Tabei Junko, who reached the top from the South Col in 1975. She was climbing with the first all-women expedition to Everest (although male Sherpas supported the climb). Mount Everest has long been revered by local peoples. Its most common Tibetan name, Chomolungma, means “Goddess Mother of the World” or “Goddess of the Valley.” The Sanskrit name Sagarmatha means literally “Peak of Heaven.” Mount Everest was also previously referred to as Peak XV; it was renamed for Sir George Everest in 1865. Mount Everest , mountain on the crest of the Great Himalayas of southern Asia that lies on the border between Nepal and the Tibet Autonomous Region of China , at 27°59′ N 86°56′ E. Reaching an elevation of 29,032 feet (8,849 meters), Mount Everest is the highest mountain in the world. Like other high peaks in the region, Mount Everest has long been revered by local peoples. Its most common Tibetan name, Chomolungma, means “Goddess Mother of the World” or “Goddess of the Valley.” The Sanskrit name Sagarmatha means literally “Peak of Heaven.” Its identity as the highest point on the Earth’s surface was not recognized, however, until 1852, when the governmental Survey of India established that fact. In 1865 the mountain—previously referred to as Peak XV—was renamed for Sir George Everest , British surveyor general of India from 1830 to 1843. According to etymological sources, the mountain’s Western name is often mispronounced “Ever-est” or “Ev-rest,” despite the pronunciation of Sir George Everest’s surname being “EVE-rest.” The Himalayan ranges were thrust upward by tectonic action as the Indian-Australian Plate moved northward from the south and was subducted (forced downward) under the Eurasian Plate following the collision of the two plates between about 40 and 50 million years ago. The Himalayas themselves started rising about 25 to 30 million years ago, and the Great Himalayas began to take their present form during the Pleistocene Epoch (about 2,600,000 to 11,700 years ago). Everest and its surrounding peaks are part of a large mountain massif that forms a focal point, or knot, of this tectonic action in the Great Himalayas. Information from global positioning instruments in place on Everest since the late 1990s indicates that the mountain continues to move a few inches to ",

This iconic measurement represents not just a geographical truth but also a symbol of human curiosity, technological advancement, and international cooperation. Whether you're an aspiring trekker, a passionate geographer, or just curious, knowing the true Height of Mount Everest adds depth to the legend of this majestic Himalayan giant. Mount Everest, known as Sagarmatha in Nepali and Chomolungma in Tibetan, holds the awe-inspiring title of the World's Highest Mountain . But how tall is Mount Everest exactly? The answer is both simple and fascinating, involving science, geography, and a bit of controversy. The official height of Mount Everest is 8,848.86 meters (29,031.7 feet) above sea level. This measurement was jointly declared by Nepal and China in 2020 , resolving a long-standing discrepancy between previous measurements. This updated figure includes the snow cap on the summit, providing a more accurate and universally accepted height. Over the years, Everest’s height has been calculated multiple times using increasingly advanced technology: The 2020 survey used Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and ground-penetrating radar to measure both the rock height and the snow layer. Yes, Mount Everest’s height is not fixed . Several factors cause subtle fluctuations: Plate tectonics : Everest sits on the collision zone of the Indian and Eurasian plates , which causes it to rise a few millimeters every year. Earthquakes : The 2015 Nepal earthquake slightly altered the mountain's structure, prompting further studies on its elevation. Climate change : Melting glaciers and snow compaction may also influence summit height over time. Height above sea level : 8,848.86 meters – the most accepted method globally. Topographic prominence : Mount Everest also ranks as the most prominent peak in the world, standing dramatically above all nearby terrain. Here’s how Everest compares to other giants: No peak on Earth surpasses Mount Everest in sheer vertical elevation above sea level. Understanding Everest’s precise height is more than a trivia fact—it’s crucial for: Geological research and tectonic studies Mountaineering logistics and oxygen planning Tourism and mapping accuracy International collaboration in science If measured from the Earth’s center, Mount Chimborazo in Ecuador is technically farther from the core due to the equatorial bulge. Everest’s summit grows approximately 4 mm per year due to plate movement. The summit is in the death zone —an altitude above 8,000 meters where oxygen levels are dangerously low.

      "text": "The #1 Guide Service for Climbing Kilimanjaro Mount Everest is the tallest mountain on Earth, standing at a height of 29,032 feet (8,849 meters) , or roughly 8.8 kilometers (5.5 miles) high. It is part of the Himalayan mountain range and is located on the border between Nepal and Tibet. To put this in perspective, Mount Everest is significantly taller than some of the world’s most famous structures. The measurement of Mount Everest’s height has evolved over time, with advances in technology bringing more accuracy. The earliest measurement was conducted in the 19th century by the Great Trigonometric Survey of India, using ground-based surveying techniques. In recent years, scientists have used GPS technology, satellite data, and radar to measure the mountain’s exact height. In 2020, a joint effort by China and Nepal used the latest equipment to precisely measure the peak at 29,032 feet (8,849 meters). Prior to this, the widely accepted height was 29,029 feet (8,848 meters), but the latest measurements accounted for snow depth and tectonic activity. Mount Everest’s height is not a constant figure; it changes due to a variety of natural factors. The primary reason is tectonic activity. The mountain lies on the boundary of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. When these plates collide, they cause the Himalayas, including Everest, to slowly rise. Conversely, major earthquakes can cause slight reductions in height. For instance, the 2015 Nepal earthquake was thought to have slightly altered Everest’s height. Additionally, the snow and ice covering the summit can vary seasonally and annually, further affecting its measured height. Mount Everest is the highest peak in the world in terms of altitude above sea level. However, other mountains can claim records of their own. For example, Mauna Kea in Hawaii, when measured from its base on the ocean floor, stands taller than Everest, reaching 33,500 feet (10,210 meters) from base to summit. Still, when measured from sea level, Everest holds the title. In comparison, K2 , the second-highest mountain on Earth, is 28,251 feet (8,611 meters) tall, making Everest nearly 800 feet taller. While the summit of Mount Everest reaches the highest altitude, the journey begins much lower. Everest Base Camp on the south side in Nepal is located at an elevation of approximately 17,598 feet (5,364 meters). This base camp serves as the starting point for climbers attempting to reach the summit. On the north side, in Tibet, the base camp is slightly higher, sitting at about 17,060 feet (5,200 meters). Despite these high elevations, the camps are still nearly 12,000 feet below the summit. Climbers spend time at base camp to acclimatize to the high altitude before making their ascent. Climbing Mount Everest is an extraordinary challenge due to its extreme height and the associated altitude. The summit of Everest extends into the “ death zone ,” which is above 26,000 feet (7,925 meters). In this zone, the oxygen level is so lo",
