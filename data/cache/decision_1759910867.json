      "text": "The capital of Japan is Tokyo . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Throughout history, the national capital of Japan has been in locations other than Tokyo. The oldest capital is Nara . While no laws have designated Tokyo as the Japanese capital, many laws have defined a \"capital area\" ( 首都圏 , shuto-ken ) that incorporates Tokyo. Article 2 of the Metropolitan Area Readjustment Act ( 首都圏整備法 ) of 1956 states: \"In this Act, the term 'capital area' shall denote a broad region comprising both the territory of the Tokyo Metropolis as well as outlying regions designated by cabinet order.\" This implies that the government has designated Tokyo as the capital of Japan, although (again) it is not explicitly stated, and the definition of the \"capital area\" is purposely restricted to the terms of that specific law. [ 4 ] Other laws referring to the \"capital area\" include the Capital Expressway Public Corporation Law ( 首都高速道路公団法 ) , [ 5 ] the Capital Area Greenbelt Preservation Law ( 首都圏近郊緑地保全法 ) , the Act on Arrangement of Suburban Development and Redevelopment Areas and Urban Development Areas in Metropolitan Area ( 首都圏の近郊整備地帯及び都市開発区域の整備に関する法律 ) , the Act on State's Special Financial Measures on Arrangement of Suburban Development and Redevelopment Areas, etc. in Tokyo Metropolitan Area, Kinki Area and Chubu Area ( 首都圏、近畿圏及び中部圏の近郊整備地帯等の整備のための国の財政上の特別措置に関する法律 ) , and the Special Measurements for Greater Tokyo Area earthquakes Law ( 首都直下地震対策特別措置法 ) . [ 6 ] [ 7 ] In February 2018, Seiji Osaka , a member of the House of Representatives , asked the government where the capital of Japan is. In response, Shinzo Abe stated that while no laws define the capital of Japan, they believed that \"the capital of Japan is Tokyo is widely accepted by the people\". [ 8 ] [ 9 ] Traditionally, the home of the Emperor is considered the capital. From 794 through 1868, the Emperor lived in Heian-kyō , modern-day Kyoto . [ 10 ] [ 11 ] After 1868, the seat of the Government of Japan and the location of the Emperor's home was moved to Edo , which it renamed Tokyo. [ 12 ] This term for capital was never used to refer to Kyoto. Indeed, shuto came into use during the 1860s as a gloss of the English term \"capital\". In 1941, the Ministry of Education published the \"designation of Tokyo as capital\" ( 東京奠都 , Tōkyō-tento ) . [ 13 ] The Ministry of Education published a book called \"History of the Restoration\" in 1941. This book referred to \"designating Tokyo as capital\" ( 東京奠都 , Tōkyō-tento ) without talking about \"relocating the capital to Tokyo\" ( 東京遷都 , Tōkyō-sento ) . A contemporary history textbook states that the Meiji government \"moved the capital ( shuto ) from Kyoto to Tokyo\" without using the sento term. [ 13 ] The proposals to move the capital were conceptualized in 1979, and 16 years later, in 1995, the parliament voted to move the capital away from Tokyo to a place no more than 180 miles and 40 minutes away from the airport, which was planned to be completed in 2010.

With a population of over 14 million in the city proper in 2023, it is one of the most populous urban areas in the world . The Greater Tokyo Area , which includes Tokyo and parts of six neighboring prefectures , is the most populous metropolitan area in the world, with 41 million residents as of 2024 [update] . Lying at the head of Tokyo Bay , Tokyo is part of the Kantō region , on the central coast of Honshu , Japan's largest island. It is Japan's economic center and the seat of the Japanese government and the Emperor of Japan . The Tokyo Metropolitan Government administers Tokyo's central 23 special wards , which formerly made up Tokyo City ; various commuter towns and suburbs in its western area ; and two outlying island chains, the Tokyo Islands . Although most of the world recognizes Tokyo as a city, since 1943 its governing structure has been more akin to that of a prefecture, with an accompanying Governor and Assembly taking precedence over the smaller municipal governments that make up the metropolis. Special wards in Tokyo include Chiyoda , the site of the National Diet Building and the Tokyo Imperial Palace ; Shinjuku , the city's administrative center; and Shibuya , a hub of commerce and business. Tokyo, originally known as Edo, rose to political prominence in 1603 when it became the seat of the Tokugawa shogunate, and by the mid-18th century, Edo had evolved from a small fishing village into one of the largest cities in the world, with a population surpassing one million. After the Meiji Restoration (1868), the imperial capital in Kyoto was moved to Edo, and the city was renamed Tokyo ( lit. ' Eastern Capital ' ). Tokyo was greatly damaged by the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake and by allied bombing raids during World War II . From the late 1940s, Tokyo underwent rapid reconstruction and expansion, which fueled the Japanese economic miracle , in which Japan's economy became the second-largest in the world at the time , behind that of the United States . [ 9 ] As of 2023 [update] , Tokyo is home to 29 of the world's 500 largest companies, as listed in the annual Fortune Global 500 —the second highest number of any city. [ 10 ] Tokyo was the first city in Asia to host the Summer Olympics and Paralympics , in 1964 and then in 2021. It also hosted three G7 summits, in 1979 , 1986 , and 1993 . Tokyo is an international hub of research and development and an academic center, with several major universities , including the University of Tokyo , the top-ranking university in Japan. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Tokyo Station is the central hub for the Shinkansen , the country's high-speed railway network; and the city's Shinjuku Station is the world's busiest train station. Tokyo Skytree is the world's tallest tower. [ 13 ] The Tokyo Metro Ginza Line , which opened in 1927, is the oldest underground metro line in Asia. [ 14 ] Tokyo's nominal gross domestic outp",

      "text": "Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. Tokyo , city and capital of Tokyo to (metropolis) and of Japan . It is located at the head of Tokyo Bay on the Pacific coast of central Honshu . It is the focus of the vast metropolitan area often called Greater Tokyo, the largest urban and industrial agglomeration in Japan. A brief treatment of Tokyo follows. For full treatment, see Tokyo-Yokohama metropolitan area . The site of Tokyo has been inhabited since ancient times; the small fishing village of Edo existed there for centuries. Edo’s development into a city did not occur until the Tokugawa period (1603–1867), when it became the capital of the Tokugawa shogunate. During this period, however, the imperial family remained in Kyōto, the ancient imperial capital. With the Meiji Restoration of 1868, which ended the shogunate, the capital was moved to Edo. The city was renamed Tokyo, meaning “eastern capital.” Edo had been Japan’s largest city since the 17th century. Tokyo’s population exceeded one million in the late 19th century, and as Japan’s political, economic, and cultural centre it became one of the world’s most populous cities in the 20th century. The city is built on low, alluvial plains and adjacent upland hills. The climate is mild in winter and hot and humid in the summer. Early summer and early autumn are rainy seasons; two or three typhoons usually occur during September and October. The metropolitan area is the largest industrial, commercial, and financial centre in Japan. Many domestic and international financial institutions and other businesses are headquartered in central Tokyo. The city is an important wholesale centre, where goods from all parts of the country and the world are distributed. Tokyo is part of the Keihin Industrial Zone , centred on the western shore of the bay, which has become the country’s leading manufacturing region. Light and labour-intensive industries predominate in the city, notably printing and publishing and the manufacture of electronic equipment. Encircled by stone-walled moats and broad gardens, the Imperial Palace , the home of the emperor of Japan, lies at the heart of the city. East of and adjacent to the Imperial Palace is the colourful Marunouchi district, the financial hub and a major centre of Japanese business activity. South of the palace is the Kasumigaseki district, containing many national government offices. West of that is Nagatacho, where the National Diet Building (parliament) is located. Tokyo has no single central business district, but the city is dotted with urban centres, usually around railroad stations, where department stores, shops, hotels, office buildings, and restaurants are clustered. In between are less intensively developed neighbourhoods with similar mixtures. The buildings in these districts range from stone and brick structures of the Meiji period (1868–1912) to postwar concrete and steel skyscrapers; there are also a dwind",
