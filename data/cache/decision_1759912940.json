Primary site navigation Logged in as: Correspondence: Prof Tan Siang Yong, 2226 Liliha Street, Suite B-104, Honolulu, HI 96817, USA. siang@hawaii.edu “ I did not invent penicillin. Nature did that. I only discovered it by accident .” Alexander Fleming was a Scottish physician-scientist who was recognised for discovering penicillin. The simple discovery and use of the antibiotic agent has saved millions of lives, and earned Fleming – together with Howard Florey and Ernst Chain, who devised methods for the large-scale isolation and production of penicillin – the 1945 Nobel Prize in Physiology/Medicine. On August 6, 1881, Alexander Fleming was born to Hugh Fleming and Grace Stirling Morton in Lochfield Farm, Scotland. Initially schooled in Scotland, Fleming eventually moved to London with three brothers and a sister, and completed his youth education at the Regent Street Polytechnic. He did not enter medical school immediately after; instead, he worked in a shipping office for four years. When his uncle John died, he willed equal shares of his estate to his siblings, nieces and nephews, and Fleming was able to use his share to pursue a medical education. In 1906, he graduated with distinction from St Mary’s Medical School at London University. Fleming did not intend to begin a career in research. While serving as a private in the London Scottish Regiment of the Territorial Army, he became a recognised marksman. Wishing to keep Fleming in St Mary’s to join its rifle club, the club’s captain convinced him to pursue a career in research rather than in surgery, as the latter choice would require him to leave the school. The captain introduced him to Sir Almroth Wright, a keen club member and a pioneer in immunology and vaccine research, who agreed to take Fleming under his wing. It was with this research group that Fleming stayed throughout his entire career. When World War I broke out, Fleming served in the Army Medical Corps as a captain. During this time, he observed the death of many of his fellow soldiers, not always from wounds inflicted in battle, but from the ensuing infection that could not be controlled. The primary means to combat infection was antiseptics, which frequently did more harm than good. In an article he wrote during this time, Fleming discussed the presence of anaerobic bacteria in deep wounds, which proliferated despite antiseptics. Initially, his research was not accepted, but Fleming continued undaunted and in 1922, he discovered lysozyme, an enzyme with weak antibacterial properties. History tells us that, while infected with a cold, Fleming transferred some of his nasopharynge",

Previously there were no effective treatments against a range of bacterial infections from pneumonia to sepsis. Penicillin became the basis for curing bacterial infections including smallpox, cholera, tuberculosis, scarlet fever, pneumonia, gonorrhea, meningitis, and diphtheria. Later antibiotics would form a class of medicines designed to combat, and cure, bacterial infections but also prevent the further growth of such infections. The use of fungi and molds, which contain antibacterial substances, to treat bacterial infections can be traced back to ancient cultures around the world, but these early attempts were unable to identify the component that provided the medicinal effect. Joseph Lister (1827-1912), an English surgeon and the \"Father of antisepsis,\" recognized the antibacterial component of mold, but did not publish his findings. In the 1870s, Robert Koch (1843-1910), a German biologist, and Louis Pasteur (1825-1895) and Jules Francois Joubert (1834-1910), two French biologists, discovered the germ theory , which established that particular bacteria cause specific diseases. Additionally, they proved that the effects of introducing certain bacteria to various cultures inhibited the growth of more deadly bacteria. The discovery of penicillin represented a turning point in medical history while Fleming would later be recognized by Time magazine as one of the most influential people of the 20th century: When I woke up just after dawn on September 28, 1928 I certainly didn't plan to revolutionize all medicine by discovering the world's first antibiotic, or bacteria killer. But I suppose that is exactly what I did. Alexander Fleming joined the Royal Army Medical Corps during World War I (1914-18). Working primarily in hospitals located on the Western Front, Fleming was exposed to the horrific injuries suffered by troops, especially from explosions from artillery and mortars. As a result of those wounds, soldiers developed sepsis, often dying from that blood infection. Fleming began studying both the wounds and treatments used to combat infections. Fleming's research proved that the Lister approach, aka Lister Antisepsis System named after Joseph Lister who first applied the germ theory to wounds and surgery, which treated wounds with antiseptics like iodine and carbolic acid did not penetrate far enough into the deepest wounds, thus not killing all of the harmful bacteria. In fact, the Lister system contributed to higher casualty rates as the antiseptics also killed natural therapeutic characteristics. Fleming's findings about the Lister system and war wounds were published in a 1917 edition of the Lancet but largely ignored by most frontline doctors. Fleming recommended that the antiseptics be used with a hi",

Commemorative Booklet (PDF) In Arabic: اكتشاف البنسلين وتطويره In Mandarin: 青霉素的发现与发展 In Spanish: Descubrimiento y desarrollo de la penicilina The introduction of penicillin in the 1940s, which began the era of antibiotics, has been recognized as one of the greatest advances in therapeutic medicine. The discovery of penicillin and the initial recognition of its therapeutic potential occurred in the United Kingdom, but, due to World War II, the United States played the major role in developing large-scale production of the drug, thus making a life-saving substance in limited supply into a widely available medicine. Penicillin heralded the dawn of the antibiotic age. Before its introduction there was no effective treatment for infections such as pneumonia, gonorrhea or rheumatic fever. Hospitals were full of people with blood poisoning contracted from a cut or a scratch, and doctors could do little for them but wait and hope. Antibiotics are compounds produced by bacteria and fungi which are capable of killing, or inhibiting, competing microbial species. This phenomenon has long been known; it may explain why the ancient Egyptians had the practice of applying a poultice of moldy bread to infected wounds. But it was not until 1928 that penicillin, the first true antibiotic, was discovered by Alexander Fleming, Professor of Bacteriology at St. Mary's Hospital in London. Returning from holiday on September 3, 1928, Fleming began to sort through petri dishe",
