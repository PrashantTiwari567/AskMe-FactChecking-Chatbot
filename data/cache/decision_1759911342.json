      "text": "The instantaneous Earth–Moon distance, or distance to the Moon, is the distance from the center of Earth to the center of the Moon. In contrast, the Lunar distance, or Earth–Moon characteristic distance, is a unit of measure in astronomy. More technically, it is the semi-major axis of the geocentric lunar orbit. The average lunar distance is approximately 385,000 km (239,000 mi), or 1.3 light-seconds. It is roughly 30 times Earth's diameter and a non-stop plane flight traveling that distance would take more than two weeks. Around 389 lunar distances make up an astronomical unit.",

      "text": "The Moon is Earth 's only natural satellite . It orbits around Earth at an average distance of 384,399 kilometres (238,854 mi), [ f ] about 30 times Earth's diameter , and completes an orbit ( lunar month ) every 29.5 days. This is the same length it takes the Moon to complete a rotation ( lunar day ). The rotation period is synchronized with the orbital period by Earth's gravity forcing the Moon to face Earth always with the same side , making it tidally locked . The Moon's gravity causes tidal forces on Earth, which are the main driver of Earth's tides . In geophysical terms , the Moon is a planetary-mass object or satellite planet . Its mass is 1.2% that of the Earth, and its diameter is 3,474 km (2,159 mi), roughly one-quarter of Earth's (about as wide as the contiguous United States ). Within the Solar System , it is larger and more massive than any known dwarf planet , and the fifth-largest and fifth-most massive moon, as well as the largest and most massive in relation to its parent planet . [ 18 ] Its surface gravity is about one-sixth of Earth's, about half that of Mars , and the second-highest among all moons in the Solar System after Jupiter 's moon Io . The body of the Moon is differentiated and terrestrial , with only a minuscule hydrosphere , atmosphere , and magnetic field . The lunar surface is covered in regolith dust , which mainly consists of the fine material ejected from the lunar crust by impact events . The lunar crust is marked by impact craters , with some younger ones featuring bright ray-like streaks . The Moon was volcanically active until 1.2 billion years ago, surfacing lava mostly on the thinner near side of the Moon, filling ancient craters, which through cooling formed the today prominently visible dark plains of basalt called maria ('seas'). The Moon formed out of material from Earth, ejected by a giant impact into Earth of a hypothesized Mars-sized body named Theia 4.51 billion years ago, not long after Earth's formation . From a distance, the day and night phases of the lunar day are visible as the lunar phases , and when the Moon passes through Earth's shadow a lunar eclipse is observable. The Moon's apparent size in Earth's sky is about the same as that of the Sun, which causes it to cover the Sun completely during a total solar eclipse . The Moon is the brightest celestial object in Earth's night sky because of its large apparent size, while the reflectance (albedo) of its surface is comparable to that of asphalt . About 59% of the surface of the Moon is visible from Earth owing to the different angles at which the Moon can appear in Earth's sky ( libration ), making parts of the far side of the Moon visible. The Moon has been an important source of inspiration and knowledge in human history, having been crucial to cosmography , mythology , religion , art, time keeping , natural science and spaceflight . The first human-made objects to fly to an extraterrestrial body were sent to the Moon, starting in 1959 w",

Don’t be fooled! They’re actually really far apart. The Moon is an average of 238,855 miles (384,400 km) away. How far away is that? That’s 30 Earths. Why mention the average distance? Well, the Moon is not always the same distance away from Earth. The orbit is not a perfect circle. When the Moon is the farthest away, it’s 252,088 miles away. That’s almost 32 Earths . When it's closest, the Moon is 225,623 miles away. That’s between 28 and 29 Earths. The Moon definitely seems close because we can see it so well without a telescope, but remember, it’s farther away than most people realize! Distance to the Moon (Educator Guide) Launchpad: Moon Magic To see for yourself how far apart Earth and the moon are, try this: *If Earth was the size of a basketball, the moon would be the size of a tennis ball. This can give you an idea of how they compare. Use nearby objects to remember how far 23 feet 9 inches is from the basketball. Ask others to place the tennis ball where they think the moon is. They will be very surprised when you show them how far away it needs to be!

      "text": "What is the distance between the Earth and the Moon? The answer is not as simple as you think... The Moon is the most recognisable object in the night sky, and has an enormous impact on life here on Earth. But what is the exact distance between the Earth and the Moon? And why is that question not as simple as it sounds? Royal Observatory astronomer Affelia Wibisono explains all... The average distance between the Earth and the Moon is 384 400 km (238 855 miles) . Light travels at 300,000 kilometres per second, so it takes about 1.3 seconds for light to travel from the Moon back to the Earth. In other words, the Moon is 1.3 light-seconds away from the Earth . Please allow all cookies to watch the video. No orbit is perfectly circular. Some are very close, but they are all at least slightly elliptical in shape. Astronomers can measure how near to a perfect circle an orbit is by calculating its 'eccentricity'. This is expressed by a number that is between 0 and 1. The closer the eccentricity is to 0, the closer the orbit is to a circle. In fact, a circle can be thought of as a special kind of ellipse that has an eccentricity of 0. Venus’ orbit is the least eccentric out of all of the planets in our Solar System and closest to a circle, with a value of 0.007. Mercury’s is the most eccentric with a value of 0.2. The eccentricity of the Moon’s orbit is 0.05 . Furthermore, the Earth is not at the very centre of the Moon’s orbit either. It is located at one of the foci of the Moon’s elliptical orbit, so is closer to one edge of the orbit than the other. Astronomers tend to talk about three different numbers when talking about the distance between the Earth and the Moon. At its furthest point from the Earth, the Moon is about 405 696 km (252 088 miles) away and astronomers say that the Moon is at apogee (‘apo’ means ‘away’). On the other hand, when the Moon is at perigee (‘peri’ means ‘near’), the Moon is at its closest approach to the Earth . The distance between them is only 363 104 km (225 623 miles). These two figures differ by 42 592 km (26 465 miles) - more than three times larger than the diameter of the Earth! The average distance between the Earth and the Moon is 384 400 km (238 855 miles) . The Moon’s elliptical orbit with the distances at apogee and perigee. Note that the Earth is not at the very centre of the orbit and that the eccentricity of the orbit has been exaggerated here! Credit: NASA/Luc Viator/Affelia Wibisono. But do the two distances affect us in any way? Not really. The full Moon will look slightly bigger if it occurs during perigee (sometimes called a supermoon) and slightly smaller at apogee (a micromoon). However, the difference won’t be easily noticeable to the naked eye and a side by side photographic comparison is the only way to really see it.
