For more information on the Visual Elements image see the Uses and properties section below. Glossary Group A vertical column in the periodic table. Members of a group typically have similar properties and electron configurations in their outer shell. Period A horizontal row in the periodic table. The atomic number of each element increases by one, reading from left to right. Block Elements are organised into blocks by the orbital type in which the outer electrons are found. These blocks are named for the characteristic spectra they produce: sharp (s), principal (p), diffuse (d), and fundamental (f). Atomic number The number of protons in an atom. Electron configuration The arrangements of electrons above the last (closed shell) noble gas. Melting point The temperature at which the solid–liquid phase change occurs. Boiling point The temperature at which the liquid–gas phase change occurs. Sublimation The transition of a substance directly from the solid to the gas phase without passing through a liquid phase. Density (g cm −3 ) Density is the mass of a substance that would fill 1 cm 3 at room temperature. Relative atomic mass The mass of an atom relative to that of carbon-12. This is approximately the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. Where more than one isotope exists, the value given is the abundance weighted average. Isotopes Atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons. CAS number The Chemical Abstracts Service registry number is a unique identifier of a particular chemical, designed to prevent confusion arising from different languages and naming systems. Glossary Image explanation Murray Robertson is the artist behind the images which make up Visual Elements. This is where the artist explains his interpretation of the element and the science behind the picture. Appearance The description of the element in its natural form. Biological role The role of the element in humans, animals and plants. Natural abundance Where the element is most commonly found in nature, and how it is sourced commercially. Atomic radius, non-bonded Half of the distance between two unbonded atoms of the same element when the electrostatic forces are balanced. These values were determined using several different methods. Covalent radius Half of the distance between two atoms within a single covalent bond. Values are given for typical oxidation number and coordination. Electron affinity The energy released when an electron is added to the neutral atom and a negative ion is formed. Electronegativity (Pauling scale) The tendency of an atom to attract electrons towards itself, expressed on a relative scale. First ionisation energy The minimum energy required to remove an electron from a neutral atom in its ground state.",

Narrator: 00:16 Gold is a chemical element with the atomic number 79 on the periodic table. It has one of the highest atomic numbers of any element that occurs naturally. An atomic number measures the number of protons contained in the nucleus of each atom comprising an element. The higher an element's atomic number, the heavier it will be. This is why gold is so dense and heavy. Gold is one of the least reactive and most solid chemical elements. It is also the most malleable of all metals. In fact, a single ounce of gold could be compressed into a thin sheet that would span a total of 300 square feet. When formed into a monotonic wire, it can be stretched about twice before it would break, making it optimal for microelectronics and other applications. Gold's chemical symbol AU is derived from the Latin word aurum, meaning gold. Some claim that the word aurum also means shining dawn due to its etymological ties to the word aurora, meaning dawn. The word gold comes from the old English word for yellow, geolu, which was derived from the Germanic word gulþa. Today, gold is everywhere, and in many of the devices we use on a daily basis.
