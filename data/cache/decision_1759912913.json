      "text": "‘The most impossible job on earth’ Whoever succeeds Ban Ki-moon at the United Nations will face the same frustrations as his or her predecessors — authority without decisive power. T he first UN secretary-general, Trygve Lie (who served 1946-52), described the post to his successor, Dag Hammarskjöld, as “the most impossible job on earth” and time has not made it any easier. The UN charter makes the secretary-general (SG) the chief administrative officer, but also an independent official whom the General Assembly and Security Council can entrust with unspecified but implicitly political tasks. It is up to each holder of the office to demonstrate whether he or she is more “secretary” than “general”. Paradoxes abound. The SG is expected to enjoy the backing of governments, especially the five permanent members of the Security Council, the Perm Five or P-5 — US, China, UK, France and Russia — but also to show impartiality. The SG establishes credentials by bureaucratic or diplomatic service, but, once elected, must transcend that past and serve as a voice of the world — even a “secular pope”. The SG is entrusted with helping member states to make sound and well-informed decisions, which he/she then has to execute, but can also influence their work and even propose actions they should undertake. The SG administers a complex organisation of more than 41,000 people and serves as head of the UN agencies ( 1 ) , but must respect budgetary and regulatory constraints imposed by the member governments. The SG has an unparalleled agenda-shaping authority, but does not have the power to execute all ideas, and articulates a vision that only governments can fulfil. The SG moves the world, but cannot direct it. Hammarskjöld (1953-61) first argued at the height of the cold war that an impartial civil servant could be “politically celibate” without being “politically virgin”. The SG could play a political role without losing personal impartiality, though this was conditional on keeping faithfully to the charter and international law. UN SG races are nothing like the razzmatazz of American presidential campaigns. They are fought so discreetly as to be almost clandestine, and have a very limited electorate: the 15 members of the Security Council, who are supposed to agree on a single name to forward to the UN General Assembly. Majorities in the 193-member assembly are largely irrelevant: it has always endorsed the Security Council’s nomination. What really counts is victory in the Council, where the Perm Five enjoy a veto. This year the challenge will be for Eastern Europe to come up with a candidate who will not attract a Russian or American veto; the other three members of the P-5 are unlikely to veto a European. If all Eastern European candidates are vetoed, a plausible national of the Western Europe and Others group, from Oceania, such as the former New Zealand prime minister Helen Clark, currently a UN under-secretary-general, could stand a chance; there is wide",
