      "text": "The instantaneous Earth–Moon distance, or distance to the Moon, is the distance from the center of Earth to the center of the Moon. In contrast, the Lunar distance, or Earth–Moon characteristic distance, is a unit of measure in astronomy. More technically, it is the semi-major axis of the geocentric lunar orbit. The average lunar distance is approximately 385,000 km (239,000 mi), or 1.3 light-seconds. It is roughly 30 times Earth's diameter and a non-stop plane flight traveling that distance would take more than two weeks. Around 389 lunar distances make up an astronomical unit.",

One complete orbit takes 365.256 days (1 sidereal year ), during which time Earth has traveled 940 million km (584 million mi). [ 2 ] Ignoring the influence of other Solar System bodies, Earth's orbit , also called Earth's revolution , is an ellipse with the Earth–Sun barycenter as one focus with a current eccentricity of 0.0167. Since this value is close to zero, the center of the orbit is relatively close to the center of the Sun (relative to the size of the orbit). As seen from Earth, the planet's orbital prograde motion makes the Sun appear to move with respect to other stars at a rate of about 1° eastward per solar day (or a Sun or Moon diameter every 12 hours). [ nb 1 ] Earth's orbital speed averages 29.78 km/s (18.50 mi/s; 107,208.00 km/h; 66,615.96 mph), which is fast enough to cover the planet's diameter in 7 minutes and the distance to the Moon in 4 hours. [ 3 ] The point towards which the Earth in its solar orbit is directed at any given instant is known as the \"apex of the Earth's way\". [ 4 ] [ 5 ] From a vantage point above the north pole of either the Sun or Earth, Earth would appear to revolve in a counterclockwise direction around the Sun. From the same vantage point, both the Earth and the Sun would appear to rotate also in a counterclockwise direction. Heliocentrism is the scientific model that first placed the Sun at the center of the Solar System and put the planets, including Earth, in its orbit. Historically, heliocentrism is opposed to geocentrism , which placed the Earth at the center. Aristarchus of Samos already proposed a heliocentric model in the third century BC. In the sixteenth century, Nicolaus Copernicus ' De revolutionibus presented a full discussion of a heliocentric model of the universe [ 6 ] in much the same way as Ptolemy had presented his geocentric model in the second century. This \" Copernican Revolution \" resolved the issue of planetary retrograde motion by arguing that such motion was only perceived and apparent. According to historian Jerry Brotton , \"Although Copernicus's groundbreaking book ... had been [printed more than] a century earlier, [the Dutch mapmaker] Joan Blaeu was the first mapmaker to incorporate his revolutionary heliocentric theory into a map of the world.\" [ 7 ] Because of Earth's axial tilt (often known as the obliquity of the ecliptic ), the inclination of the Sun's trajectory in the sky (as seen by an observer on Earth's surface) varies over the course of the year. For an observer at a northern latitude, when the north pole is tilted toward the Sun the day lasts longer and the Sun appears higher in the sky. This results in warmer average temperatures, as additional solar radiation reaches the surface. When the north pole is tilted away from the Sun, the reverse is true and the weather is g",

Don’t be fooled! They’re actually really far apart. The Moon is an average of 238,855 miles (384,400 km) away. How far away is that? That’s 30 Earths. Why mention the average distance? Well, the Moon is not always the same distance away from Earth. The orbit is not a perfect circle. When the Moon is the farthest away, it’s 252,088 miles away. That’s almost 32 Earths . When it's closest, the Moon is 225,623 miles away. That’s between 28 and 29 Earths. The Moon definitely seems close because we can see it so well without a telescope, but remember, it’s farther away than most people realize! Distance to the Moon (Educator Guide) Launchpad: Moon Magic To see for yourself how far apart Earth and the moon are, try this: *If Earth was the size of a basketball, the moon would be the size of a tennis ball. This can give you an idea of how they compare. Use nearby objects to remember how far 23 feet 9 inches is from the basketball. Ask others to place the tennis ball where they think the moon is. They will be very surprised when you show them how far away it needs to be!

      "text": "The Moon doesn't give off its own light, rather reflects that of the Sun © NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center/Arizona State University By Josh Davis The Moon is one of the most recognisable objects in the solar system. This proximity to Earth has given it immeasurable cultural significance and means it plays a key role in Earth’s tides. Explore facts about this small but mighty celestial body. The Moon is a little over a quarter the size of the Earth, with a circumference of 10,917 kilometres around the equator and a radius – the distance from the core of the Moon to the surface – of just 1,737 kilometres. In relation to Earth, the Moon is much larger than would be expected and this is thought to be due to how the Moon formed . There’s almost no atmosphere on the Moon, which means it can’t trap heat or insulate the surface. In full sunshine, temperatures on the Moon reach 127°C, way above boiling point. There are 13 and a half days of high temperatures followed by 13 and a half days of darkness, and once the Sun goes down the temperature at the bottom of craters can plummet to -173°C. Due to its tilt, some parts of the Moon’s surface never see sunlight, allowing water ice to survive in some of its craters. When India’s Chandrayaan-1 lunar orbiter passed over the north pole of the Moon in 2009 it found more than 40 craters thought to contain water ice. This confirmed a finding from the previous year that found water ice on the southern pole. In addition, the Moon contains some water trapped in its rocks. The Moon has a very thin atmosphere. © NASA/JSC The Moon is orbiting Earth at an average distance of 384,400 kilometres. It would take over 17 days non-stop to fly there on a commercial plane. Its orbit isn’t perfectly circular, but varies between 357,000 and 407,000 kilometres away. We tend to think it’s closer than it actually is simply because it’s the largest celestial object in the sky. No. The Moon is actually gradually getting further away – every single year the Moon moves about four centimetres further out. This is because there’s a small amount of friction between Earth and the tides, slowing our planet’s rotation. As Earth’s spin slows, the Moon is creeping away. It takes 27 days for the Moon to go around Earth and 27 days to rotate once on its axis. Because the Moon is orbiting Earth at the same rate at which it rotates itself, this means that the same side of the Moon always faces the Earth. This is known as synchronous rotation. Synchronous rotation is why some people call the side that never faces the planet the ‘dark side’ of the Moon. This is somewhat misleading, however – it’s more correctly referred to as the far side of the Moon. As the Moon orbits the Earth most of its surface is bathed in sunlight at some point. The far side of the Moon never faces Earth. © NASA For a long time scientists thought that there was no atmosphere on the Moon, but recent studies have confirmed that there is one.
