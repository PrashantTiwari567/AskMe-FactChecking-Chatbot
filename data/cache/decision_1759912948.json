About Map - Map showing Location of Taj Mahal in the India Map. Where Taj Mahal Located? The Taj Mahal is located in the Agra District of Uttar Pradesh on the right bank of the Yamuna River in a huge Mughal garden that spans almost 17 hectares. Shah Jahan, the Mughal emperor, constructed it in honor of his wife Mumtaz Mahal. The construction of the Taj Mahal started in the year 1623 AD and completed in the year 1648 AD. The mosque, the guesthouse, and the main entrance on the south side of the Taj Mahal were all finished by 1648. Later the exterior courtyard and its cloisters had been constructed by the year 1653 AD. A number of historical and Quranic inscriptions in Arabic script have made it easier to determine the Taj Mahal's chronology. The Taj Mahal's chief architect was Ustad-Ahmad Lahori. The Taj Mahal is an architectural style masterpiece in terms of conception, design, and implementation, and it has exceptional aesthetic qualities in terms of balance, symmetry, and the graceful blending of numerous parts. The Taj Mahal complex as a whole, including its main gate, guesthouse, mosque, and tombs, is kept intact. The Taj Mahal is regarded as the pinnacle of Indo-Islamic architecture. Its well-known architectural beauty features a rhythmic blend of solids and voids, concave and convex, and light shadow; such as arches and domes further strengthen the attractive aspect. The monument is highlighted by the color combination of a rich green landscape, a crimson road, and a blue sky above it. It is a unique monument because of the marble relief work and the inlay with precious and semi-precious stones. The horticultural planners and architects of Shah Jahan made some genuinely amazing innovations, which give Taj Mahal its uniqueness. One illustration of brilliant planning is the positioning of the tomb at one end of the quadripartite garden rather than in the exact center, which provided the monument's overall appearance rich depth and perspective in the distance. In 1983, the Taj Mahal was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in recognition of its status as \"the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage\".

It has 1.7 million inhabitants nowadays. In Agra, the Taj Mahal is in the east, in the richest areas of the city at the time of its construction. It is on the banks of the Yamuna River, 3Kms from the city center and its main train station. Contrary to what one might think the Taj Mahal is bordering the city, ie its main gate is along an urban avenue beyond which the city extends. This monument has this in common with the pyramids of the Giza plateau in Egypt, which are also on the border of Cairo. The GPS coordinates of the Taj Mahal are exactly 27 ° 10'30.05 \"North and 78 ° 2'31.76\" East. If you have Google Earth software, then click on this link or open it by double-clicking it, once downloaded: It will tell you the exact location of the mausoleum: Google Earth links . The site was not chosen at random, it met several criteria. First of all it lies to the east of the city of Agra. At the time of Shah Jahan , in the seventeenth century, this whole area was made up of Mughal gardens, residences of high dignitaries and various palaces. When we know that gardens correspond to a divine concept in Islam, we understood that this environment was rather favorable to the establishment of a tomb of empress. Then the banks of the Yamuna were interesting because this river is a tributary of the Ganges, but in the Hindu religion, the Ganges is the purifying river, the one where the ashes of the deceased are poured out to purify their souls. To locate an Imperial tomb on the banks of the Yamuna means to adhere to the idea that the waters of the river will pass into the Ganga and purify the soul of the Empress. Since Shah Jahan was a Muslim, paying attention to this allowed him to put forward his quest for understanding with respect to the Hindu population he ruled over. On this map the Taj Mahal is just south of the river just after the big bend it makes east of downtown. It is recognized by its whiteness and its regular cross just drawn, just below. It's a curious question, but it deserves an answer. Above all, it is important to know that as an emperor, Shah Jahan lacked land, he could have used one of the many lands he had, but after studying them he decided that none corresponded to what he was really searching. He decided to buy it from Raja Jai Singh, who came from Ajmer, Rajasthan. This character had this land on the edge of the Yamuna and sold it to the emperor (Has he had a choice?) In exchange for four havellis (houses) in the city of Agra. This is the columnist Abdul Hamid Lahauri who teaches us, he said in his book \"Padshahnamah\". We also find the trace of this transaction in the royal decrees",
