      "text": "This is an accepted version of this page HTTP ( Hypertext Transfer Protocol ) is an application layer protocol in the Internet protocol suite model for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. [ 1 ] HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web , where hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily access, for example by a mouse click or by tapping the screen in a web browser . Development of HTTP was initiated by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in 1989 and summarized in a simple document describing the behavior of a client and a server using the first HTTP version, named 0.9. [ 2 ] That version was subsequently developed, eventually becoming the public 1.0. [ 3 ] Development of early HTTP Requests for Comments (RFCs) started a few years later in a coordinated effort by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), with work later moving to the IETF. HTTP/1 was finalized and fully documented (as version 1.0) in 1996. [ 4 ] It evolved (as version 1.1) in 1997 and then its specifications were updated in 1999, 2014, and 2022. [ 5 ] Its secure variant named HTTPS is used by more than 85% of websites. [ 6 ] HTTP/2 , published in 2015, provides a more efficient expression of HTTP's semantics \"on the wire\". As of August 2024, [update] it is supported by 66.2% of websites [ 7 ] [ 8 ] (35.3% HTTP/2 + 30.9% HTTP/3 with backwards compatibility) and supported by almost all web browsers (over 98% of users). [ 9 ] It is also supported by major web servers over Transport Layer Security (TLS) using an Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) extension [ 10 ] where TLS 1.2 or newer is required. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] HTTP/3 , the successor to HTTP/2, was published in 2022. [ 13 ] As of February 2024, [update] it is now used on 30.9% of websites [ 14 ] and is supported by most web browsers, i.e. (at least partially) supported by 97% of users. [ 15 ] HTTP/3 uses QUIC instead of TCP for the underlying transport protocol. Like HTTP/2, it does not obsolete previous major versions of the protocol. Support for HTTP/3 was added to Cloudflare and Google Chrome first, [ 16 ] [ 17 ] and is also enabled in Firefox . [ 18 ] HTTP/3 has lower latency for real-world web pages, if enabled on the server, and loads faster than with HTTP/2, in some cases over three times faster than HTTP/1.1 (which is still commonly only enabled). [ 19 ] HTTP functions as a request–response protocol in the client–server model . A web browser , for example, may be the client whereas a process , named web server , running on a computer hosting one or more websites may be the server . The client submits an HTTP request message to the server. The server, which provides resources such as HTML files and other content or performs other functions on behalf of the client, returns a response message to the client. The response contains completion status information about the request and may also contain requ",

HTTP runs on top of the TCP/IP protocol and (later) on the QUIC protocol. Web browsers are HTTP clients that send file requests to Web servers , which in turn handle the requests via an HTTP service. HTTP was originally proposed in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee , who was a coauthor of the 1.0 specification. HTTP/1.0 (released in 1996) was “stateless”: each new request from a client established a new connection instead of handling all similar requests through the same connection between a specific client and server . HTTP/1.1 (released in 1997) includes persistent connections, decompression of HTML files by client browsers, and multiple domain names sharing the same IP address . HTTP/2 (released in 2015) was designed to solve problems with slow page loading and was a binary protocol in which binary values were used instead of plaintext as in previous versions. HTTP/3 relies on the faster QUIC protocol instead of TCP and, as of early 2022, was not yet released in final form but was supported by most browsers. In the 2010s many websites began using HTTPS (Secure HTTP), developed in 1994 by Netscape Communications Corporation and in which the SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) protocol was added to HTTP to provide a layer of encryption between browsers and servers.",

What information does a HTTP request contain? The request -- which contains specific information, such as the HTTP version type, an HTTP method, HTTP request headers and HTTP body (optional) -- happens when the browser user enters file requests by either opening a web file by typing in a URL or clicking on a hypertext link. When was http first used? In 1991 , the first documented official version of HTTP was written as a plain document, less than 700 words long, and this version was named HTTP/0.9, which supported only GET method, allowing clients to only retrieve HTML documents from the server, but not supporting any other file formats or information upload. What is HTTP status code? Sent by the server in answer to an HTTP request, consisting of an HTTP status code, response headers, and optional response body. 3-digit codes indicating the outcome of an HTTP request , categorized into 1xx (Informational), 2xx (Success), 3xx (Redirection), 4xx (Client Error), and 5xx (Server Error) blocks.
