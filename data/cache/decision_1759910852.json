As the largest telescope in space, it is equipped with high-resolution and high-sensitivity instruments, allowing it to view objects too old, distant, or faint for the Hubble Space Telescope. This enables investigations across many fields of astronomy and cosmology, such as observation of the first stars and the formation of the first galaxies, and detailed atmospheric characterization of potentially habitable exoplanets.",

      "text": "The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is an international 21st-century space observatory that was launched on 25 December 2021. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] It is intended to be the premier observatory of the 2020s, combining the largest mirror yet on a near-infrared space telescope with a suite of technologically advanced instruments from around the world. [ 3 ] The telescope is designed to last at least five and a half years (six months calibration plus five years science operations), but with a goal of ten years. [ 4 ] The limiting factor is expected to be fuel to maintain its halo orbit , of which there is enough for at least ten years. [ 4 ] It was announced in December 2021 that due to the accuracy of the orbital insertion and course correction burns, the telescope had more fuel available than originally planned and could operate for \"significantly\" longer than the original ten year planned life span. [ 5 ] JWST cost approximately $10 billion in its design, construction, and five years of operations (does not include extended mission funding), as well as international contributions. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Nearly a month after launch, a trajectory correction was initiated to place the James Webb Space Telescope into a halo orbit at L 2 . [ 48 ] [ 49 ] Its next five months were spent cooling NIRCam and the Mid-Infrared Instrument down further, aligning and calibrating its mirrors while focusing on HD 84406, a bright star in the constellation Ursa Major , and testing the instruments. [ 50 ] [ 51 ] [ 52 ] [ 53 ] Webb's first operational image was the Webb's First Deep Field , released on July 11, 2022, with it being the deepest sharp infrared image of the universe to date. [ 55 ] The rest of the first set of images was released the next day, which include full-color processed images of the Carina Nebula , Southern Ring Nebula , Stephan's Quintet , as well as spectroscopic data of WASP-96b .

Webb studies every phase in the history of our Universe, ranging from the first luminous glows after the Big Bang, to the formation of solar systems capable of supporting life on planets like Earth, to the evolution of our own Solar System. Webb launched on Dec. 25th 2021. It does not orbit around the Earth like the Hubble Space Telescope, it orbits the Sun 1.5 million kilometers (1 million miles) away from the Earth at what is called the second Lagrange point or L2.

So big it has to fold origami-style to fit in the rocket and will unfold like a “Transformer” in space. Webb orbits the Sun 1.5 million kilometers from the Earth.
