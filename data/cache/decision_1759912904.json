      "text": "The degree Celsius is the unit of temperature on the Celsius temperature scale, one of two temperature scales used in the International System of Units (SI), the other being the closely related Kelvin scale. The degree Celsius can refer to a specific point on the Celsius temperature scale or to a difference or range between two temperatures. It is named after the Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius (1701–1744), who proposed the first version of it in 1742. The unit was called centigrade in several languages for many years. In 1948, the International Committee for Weights and Measures renamed it to honor Celsius and also to remove confusion with the term for one hundredth of a gradian in some languages. Most countries use this scale.",
