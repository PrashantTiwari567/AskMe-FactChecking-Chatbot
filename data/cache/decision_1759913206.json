[ 2 ] Founded in 1975, the company became influential in the rise of personal computers through software like Windows , and the company has since expanded to Internet services, cloud computing , video gaming and other fields. Microsoft is the largest software maker , one of the most valuable public companies, [ a ] and one of the most valuable brands globally. Microsoft is considered part of the Big Tech group, alongside Nvidia , Apple , Alphabet , Amazon , and Meta . Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800 . It rose to dominate the personal computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by Windows. During the 41 years from 1980 to 2021 Microsoft released 9 versions of MS-DOS with a median frequency of 2 years, and 13 versions of Windows with a median frequency of 3 years. The company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO) and subsequent rise in its share price created three billionaires and an estimated 12,000 millionaires among Microsoft employees. Since the 1990s, it has increasingly diversified from the operating system market. Steve Ballmer replaced Gates as CEO in 2000. He oversaw the then-largest of Microsoft's corporate acquisitions in Skype Technologies in 2011, [ 3 ] and an increased focus on hardware [ 4 ] [ 5 ] that led to its first in-house PC line, the Surface , in 2012, and the formation of Microsoft Mobile through Nokia . Since Satya Nadella took over as CEO in 2014, the company has changed focus towards cloud computing , [ 6 ] [ 7 ] as well as its large acquisition of LinkedIn for $26.2 billion in 2016. [ 8 ] Under Nadella's direction, the company has also expanded its video gaming business to support the Xbox brand, establishing the Microsoft Gaming division in 2022 and acquiring Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion in 2023. [ 9 ] Microsoft has been market-dominant in the IBM PC–compatible operating system market and the office software suite market since the 1990s. Its best-known software products are the Windows line of operating systems and the Microsoft Office and Microsoft 365 suite of productivity applications, which most notably include the Word word processor, Excel spreadsheet editor, and the PowerPoint presentation program. Its flagship hardware products are the Surface lineup of personal computers and Xbox video game consoles, the latter of which includes the Xbox network ; the company also provides a range of consumer Internet services such as Bing web search, the MSN web portal, the Outlook.com ( Hotmail ) email service and the Microsoft Store . In the enterprise and development fields, Microsoft most notably provides the Azure cloud computing platform, Microsoft SQL Server database software, and Visual Studio .

      "text": "\"This is the enigma of success,\" said Satya Nadella on why the tech giant laid off thousands while showing strong financial performance. Although I doubt many would be surprised to hear a tech company executive praise AI and tout the controversial tech as \"the next stage of the internet\" – you know, much like they did with blockchain and Web3 just a few years ago – doing so less than a month after firing thousands of workers , and worse, trying to justify said firings all in the same letter, can definitely leave a bad taste in one's mouth. Still, optics didn't seem to matter much to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, who issued a statement to employees extolling artificial intelligence and, at the same time, attempting to explain why the company let go of 9,000 workers despite showing relatively strong financial performance . In his opening statement – which, I kid you not, requires a corporate-to-English translator to decipher – Nadella offered an attempt to explain why, despite rising revenue, profits, and stock prices in recent quarters, thousands of employees still lost their jobs, calling it \"the enigma of success,\" whatever that's supposed to mean. \"By every objective measure, Microsoft is thriving – our market performance, strategic positioning, and growth all point up and to the right,\" the CEO said . \"Our overall headcount is relatively unchanged, and some of the talent and expertise in our industry and at Microsoft is being recognized and rewarded at levels never seen before. And yet, at the same time, we've undergone layoffs. This is the enigma of success in an industry that has no franchise value. Progress isn't linear. It's dynamic, sometimes dissonant, and always demanding. But it's also a new opportunity for us to shape, lead through, and have greater impact than ever before.\" Having addressed the layoffs, along with the obligatory word salad about the job cuts being \"a tough decision\" for the execs and the affected employees being talented and so on – two and a half years into tech industry mass layoffs , you probably already know how this song and dance goes – Nadella wasted no time jumping into adulation for artificial intelligence, declaring that Microsoft must \"reimagine our mission for a new era\" – \"the era of AI.\" \"Just imagine if all 8 billion people could summon a researcher, an analyst, or a coding agent at their fingertips, not just to get information but use their expertise to get things done that benefit them,\" Nadella continued . \"And consider how organizations, empowered with AI, could unlock entirely new levels of agility and innovation by transforming decision-making, streamlining operations, and enabling every team to achieve more together than ever before.\" As part of this \"reimagining,\" the CEO named \"AI transformation\" as one of Microsoft's top business priorities, alongside product security and quality, stating that the company will continue \"to define new frontiers in AI.\" \"We will reimagine every layer of the tech",
