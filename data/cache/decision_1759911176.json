This pluriformity has increased since the 1960s due to massive immigration from Africa , Asia and Latin America. Immigration from Europe declined sharply during the same period. The original inhabitants make up about 1% of the total population. Most Native Americans live in the western states, often in reservations. In 1924, Native Americans were granted full U.S. citizenship, while the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 gave tribal Indians the opportunity for a high degree of self-government. John Collier, Commissioner of Indian Affairs, meets with South Dakota Blackfoot Indian chiefs in 1934 to discuss the Wheeler-Howard Act, later known as the Indian Reorganization Act Photo: Unknown author in the public domain The first Europeans to settle in American territory were the Spanish in the sixteenth century. In the seventeenth century, the English, Scots, Dutch, Germans and Irish followed. The French settled in the Mississippi Valley in the 17th and 18th centuries. From the beginning of the 19th century, the number of inhabitants began to rise spectacularly, from about 5 million in 1800 to about 75 million at the end of that century. From 1830 to the beginning of the Civil War in 1865, another massive wave of immigration from Europe followed, with many British, Germans, Irish, Dutch and Scandinavians. They were quickly and fairly quietly incorporated into existing society. After the Civil War, a second wave of immigrants from Europe started, now mainly from South and Southeastern Europe (including Hungarians, Italians, Poland, Russians, Czechs and Ukrainians). They once had completely different backgrounds from the first wave of immigrants, and often formed closed groups in the big cities that hardly integrated into society. In economic and social terms, they therefore lagged far behind the rest of the population. Health inspection of immigrants, USA Photo: NIAID CC 2.0 Generic no changes made An ink-black period in American history was the time of the slave trade, when millions of blacks from Africa were brought into the country and often employed on southern plantations. Slavery was abolished in 1863, but much of the black population of the United States still lives today in often very poor economic and social conditions. After the Second World War, many blacks moved to the major cities in the north. In 2024, blacks made up about 12.4% of the total population. Example of a slaveship that transported slaves to the USA Photo: unknown author in the public domain A very large group, currently the largest ethnic minority, are the so-called \"Hispanics\", including Mexican Americans, Porto Ricans and Cubans. This group is also in a thorny socio-economic position, and is a kind of second-class citizen. In 2024, Hispanics made up about 19% ",

What has America become? A sick violent Golem. Because the industrial nations of the world were destroyed after WWII and the US “won” the Cold War America is the world’s lone super power. After the USA “won” WWII the Bretton Woods system and other think tank operations established the ground rules. The United States became the most powerful nation the world has ever known. Even Rome did not have the 700 bases worldwide. The statistics go back and forth but more or less the United States is the wealthiest nation on earth. Then why are its people so sick? Americans are the most mentally ill people on earth and the national debt is out of control. The worst part about all this is that the “powers that be” want our messed up people to go to war! bomb4 How do we save America? End usury. End the FED. Stop all the wars. Grow real food. Take money out of religion. End the IRS. Make peace with countries like Russia and Iran. That would be a good start. starofdavid.png The Clown meme. The Zombie meme. The Joker meme. Is no accident. This once great nation has been turned into a bunch of fat stupid killers by the “Illuminati.” A Golem as Michel Collins Piper once described it. The current world population is approx. 7,455,843,740 and the population of the United States is The estimated at about 322,762,018 . Here are some stats on how the United States is doing on some very basic topics.Some of the data is shocking Sources are Wikipedia unless otherwise noted. hillary-clinton The US has a lot of people not working. 94,184,000 Not In Labor Force; Labor Force Participation Rises The US has a lot of people in jail. The United States Has the Largest Prison Population in The World. October 2013, the incarceration rate of the United States of America was the highest in the world, at 716 per 100,000 of the national population. While the United States represents about 4.4 percent of the world’s population, it houses around 22 percent of the world’s prisoner population. According to the US Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), 2,220,300 adults were incarcerated in US federal and state prisons, and county jails in 2013 – about 0.91% of adults (1 in 110) in the U.S. resident population. The United States takes the most drugs and is dying from it. Americans are suffering from the over use of street drugs and prescription drugs. The Afgan war has contributed to this greatly.The US has destroyed Afghanistan but is destroying itself via Heroin Overdose in the process. The introduction of Fentanyl has made the crisis even worse. “Fentanyl, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is up to 100 times more potent than morphine and many times that of heroin. Worse then this other even worse forms of these drugs are on the rise. Such as W-18. fentoyl Americans consume",
