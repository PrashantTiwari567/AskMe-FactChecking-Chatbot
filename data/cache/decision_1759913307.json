The ocean is conventionally divided into large bodies of water, which are also referred to as oceans, and are themselves mostly divided into seas, gulfs and subsequent bodies of water. The ocean contains 97% of Earth's water and is the primary component of Earth's hydrosphere, acting as a huge reservoir of heat for Earth's energy budget, as well as for its carbon cycle and water cycle, forming the basis for climate and weather patterns worldwide. The ocean is essential to life on Earth, harbouring most of Earth's animals and protist life, originating photosynthesis and therefore Earth's atmospheric oxygen, still supplying half of it.",

From the Arctic to the Southern, the five ocean basins are home to thousands of marine life and millions of square miles of water. The smallest ocean basin on Earth is the Arctic Ocean, which has an area of approximately 6.1 million square miles , according to the National Ocean Service. But what about the largest? Here is what you need to know about the largest ocean, plus other facts about the deep blue sea. The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's ocean basins, according to the National Ocean Service. It contains more than half of the free water on Earth, spanning around 63 million square miles . Additionally, the Pacific is the oldest of the existing ocean basins with its oldest rocks dating back to 200 million years ago. The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest ocean basin on Earth, covering an area of around 41 million square miles , according to National Ocean Service. This ocean basin makes up 20% of the Earth’s surface. The Atlantic Ocean connects to the Arctic Ocean and the Southern Ocean, also known as the Antarctic Ocean, according to the National Ocean Service.

Published by Dr. Rabiah Ryklief Principal Scientist and Lecturer of Marine Science, with a PhD in Zoology Explore the depths of our article and read our expert's opinion at the end On this list, readers can discover the ten largest oceans and seas . From the colossal Pacific Ocean , spanning an 63.8 million square miles, to the historic Mediterranean Sea , covering 970 thousand square miles. These vast bodies of water not only cover significant portions of our plane t but also include ocean basins. They are home to critical trade routes , shipping ports , and a wide variety of ecosystems and marine life . Location: Spans from the Arctic in the north to the Southern in the south. Area: 63.8 million square miles (165.2 million square kilometers). Max depth: Over 6.8 miles (11 kilometers) in the Marianna Trench. Fun fact: It was named by the explorer Ferdinand Magellan who chose “pacific” to mean “peaceful sea.” The Pacific is the largest ocean in the world, making up around 30% of the world’s surface area and almost double that in water surface area. It is home to the deepest trench on earth , the Mariana Trench , where the Challenger Deep is located . The trench is located between two tectonic plates , accounting for its incredible depth and is prone to earthquakes . Its vast basin is also home to some of the oldest rocks on Earth, marking it as a crucial part of our planet’s geological history. For example the Ring of Fire , a chain of 450 volcanoes and earthquake sites, is arranged in a U-shape along the edges of the Pacific. Today, the Pacific is home to the Great Pacific Garbage Patch , a massive collection of marine debris. This garbage patch isn’t a single entity, but rather two distinct collections of debris held together by the powerful currents of the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. Location: Between the Americas to the west and Europe and Africa to the east. Area: 41.1 million square miles (106.5 million square kilometers). Max depth: Over 5.3 miles (8,6 kilometers) in the Puerto Rico Trench. Fun fact: The Atlantic is growing wider over time due to sea-floor spreading. The Atlantic is the second-largest ocean in the world and covers around 20% of the Earth’s surface . It is thought to have formed during the Jurassic Period . Within the Atlantic are the Sargasso, Caribbean and Mediterranean Seas . The Atlantic is often split into two basins : the North and South Atlantic. In the North Atlantic, cold Arctic waters sink, initiating the “ global ocean conveyor “, a key climate-regulating current. The world’s largest island, Greenland, is also located within the North Atlantic. The Atlantic is a vital resource, providing a significant portion of the world’s fish and housing valuable mineral deposits, as well as oil, gas and coal. Additionally, it serves as a major shipping route for global trade. Location: Bordered by Africa to the west, Asia to t",

Its vast expanse shapes global weather patterns, marine ecosystems, and even human history, making it a critical component of our planet. The Pacific Ocean covers approximately 63 million square miles (165.25 million square kilometers) , representing about 30% of Earth’s total surface area. This immense size makes it larger than all of Earth’s landmasses combined. It’s bounded by Asia and Australia to the west and the Americas to the east, extending from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or Antarctica) in the south. Its deepest point, the Challenger Deep within the Mariana Trench , plunges to a staggering depth of approximately 36,070 feet (10,994 meters). Understanding its scale is crucial to grasping its significance. This ocean is not merely a body of water; it’s a driving force behind numerous global phenomena. The Pacific’s defining characteristic is undoubtedly its depth. The average depth is around 13,000 feet (4,000 meters), significantly deeper than the Atlantic or Indian Oceans. This depth contributes to unique pressure conditions and supports a diverse array of life, including species adapted to the extreme environment of the deep sea. The numerous trenches found within the Pacific, particularly the Mariana Trench , are areas of intense geological activity and home to some of the most unexplored ecosystems on Earth. The study of these deep-sea environments provides valuable insights into plate tectonics, the evolution of life, and the potential for new resources. The sheer size of the Pacific Ocean makes it a major player in global climate regulation. It absorbs a significant amount of solar radiation, influencing global temperatures and weather patterns. The El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) , a recurring climate pattern involving changes in sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, can have profound effects on weather worldwide, causing droughts, floods, and extreme temperatures in various regions. The Pacific also plays a crucial role in the generation and intensification of tropical cyclones (hurricanes and typhoons), which can bring devastating winds and rainfall to coastal areas. Understanding these interactions is paramount for predicting and mitigating the impacts of climate change. The Pacific Ocean is a biodiversity hotspot, home to an astonishing array of marine life, ranging from microscopic plankton to massive whales. Its diverse ecosystems include coral reefs, kelp forests, deep-sea vents, and open ocean habitats, each supporting unique communities of organisms. The Great Barrier Reef , located off the coast of Australia, is the world’s largest coral reef system and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, showcasing the vibrant and complex life supported by the Pacific. However, these ecosystems are increasingly threate",
