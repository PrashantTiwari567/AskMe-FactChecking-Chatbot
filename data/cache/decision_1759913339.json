      "text": "The speed of light in vacuum , commonly denoted c , is a universal physical constant exactly equal to 299,792,458 metres per second (approximately 1 billion kilometres per hour; 700 million miles per hour). It is exact because, by international agreement, a metre is defined as the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1 ⁄ 299 792 458 second . The speed of light is the same for all observers , no matter their relative velocity. It is the upper limit for the speed at which information , matter , or energy can travel through space . [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] All forms of electromagnetic radiation , including visible light , travel at the speed of light. For many practical purposes, light and other electromagnetic waves will appear to propagate instantaneously, but for long distances and sensitive measurements, their finite speed has noticeable effects. Much starlight viewed on Earth is from the distant past, allowing humans to study the history of the universe by viewing distant objects. When communicating with distant space probes , it can take hours for signals to travel. In computing , the speed of light fixes the ultimate minimum communication delay . The speed of light can be used in time of flight measurements to measure large distances to extremely high precision. Ole Rømer first demonstrated that light does not travel instantaneously by studying the apparent motion of Jupiter 's moon Io . In an 1865 paper , James Clerk Maxwell proposed that light was an electromagnetic wave and, therefore, travelled at speed c . [ 6 ] Albert Einstein postulated that the speed of light c with respect to any inertial frame of reference is a constant and is independent of the motion of the light source. [ 7 ] He explored the consequences of that postulate by deriving the theory of relativity , and so showed that the parameter c had relevance outside of the context of light and electromagnetism. Massless particles and field perturbations, such as gravitational waves , also travel at speed c in vacuum. Such particles and waves travel at c regardless of the motion of the source or the inertial reference frame of the observer . Particles with nonzero rest mass can be accelerated to approach c but can never reach it, regardless of the frame of reference in which their speed is measured. In the theory of relativity , c interrelates space and time and appears in the famous mass–energy equivalence , E = mc 2 . [ 8 ] In some cases, objects or waves may appear to travel faster than light . The expansion of the universe is understood to exceed the speed of light beyond a certain boundary . The speed at which light propagates through transparent materials , such as glass or air, is less than c ; similarly, the speed of electromagnetic waves in wire cables is slower than c . The ratio between c and the speed v at which light travels in a material is called the refractive index n of the material ( n = ⁠ c / v ⁠ ). For example, for visible light, t",

In particular, the value for the speed of light in a vacuum is now defined as exactly 299,792,458 metres per second. The speed of light is considered a fundamental constant of nature. Its significance is far broader than its role in describing a property of electromagnetic waves. It serves as the single limiting velocity in the universe , being an upper bound to the propagation speed of signals and to the speeds of all material particles. In the famous relativity equation, E = m c 2 , the speed of light ( c ) serves as a constant of proportionality, linking the formerly disparate concepts of mass ( m ) and energy ( E ).",

      "text": "The speed of light is the rate at which light travels. The speed of light in a vacuum is a constant value that is denoted by the letter c and is defined as exactly 299,792,458 meters per second. Visible light , other electromagnetic radiation, gravity waves, and other massless particles travel at c. Matter , which has mass, can approach the speed of light, but never reach it. Here are values for the speed of light in various units: The speed of light in a vacuum is a constant. However, scientists are exploring whether the speed of light has changed over time. Also, the rate at which light travels changes as it passes through a medium. The index of refraction describes this change. For example, the index of refraction of water is 1.333, which means light travels 1.333 times slower in water than in a vacuum. The index of refraction of a diamond is 2.417. A diamond slows the speed of light by more than half its speed in a vacuum. One way of measuring the speed of light uses great distances, such as distant points on the Earth or known distances between the Earth and astronomical objects. For example, you can measure the speed of light by measuring the time it takes for light to travel from a light source to a distant mirror and back again. The other way of measuring the speed of light is solving for c in equations. Now that the speed of light is defined, it is fixed rather than measured. Measuring the speed of light today indirectly measures the length of the meter, rather than c . In 1676, Danish astronomer Ole Rømer discovered light travels at a speed by studying the movement of Jupiter’s moon Io. Prior to this, it seemed light propagated instantaneously. For example, you see a lightning strike immediately, but don’t hear thunder until after the event . So, Rømer’s finding showed light takes time to travel, but scientists did not know the speed of light or whether it was constant. In 1865, James Clerk Maxwell proposed that light was an electromagnetic wave that travelled at a speed c . Albert Einstein suggested c was a constant and that it did not change according to the frame of reference of the observer or any motion of a light source. In other words, Einstein suggested the speed of light is invariant . Since then, numerous experiments have verified the invariance of c . The upper speed limit for massless particles is c . Objects that have mass cannot travel at the speed of light or exceed it. Among other reasons, traveling at c gives an object a length of zero and infinite mass. Accelerating a mass to the speed of light requires infinite energy. Furthermore, energy, signals, and individual photos cannot travel faster than c . At first glance, quantum entanglement appears to transmit information faster than c . When two particles are entangled, changing the state of one particle instantaneously determines the state of the other particle, regardless of the distance between them. But, information cannot be transmitted instantaneously (faster than ",
