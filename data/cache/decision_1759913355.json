      "text": "The official currency of the United Kingdom is the pound sterling , known as the pound (£, GBP) . Each pound is divided into 100 pence (100p = £1). The most common banknotes are £5, £10, £20, £50 and £100 . £1 notes also exist, but these are extremely rare, as only notes printed by The Bank of Scotland remain in circulation, and printing of new £1 notes ceased in 2001. The coins in circulation are 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p and £1 and £2 . Sometimes, special editions of £5 coins are released, but their circulation is merely theoretical. Here are some examples of banknotes: After Queen Elizabeth II's death in September 2022, new notes with the face of King Charles III have entered into circulation. These new banknotes will only replace those that are worn out. Those with the image of the late Queen can continue to be used as normal, so it will be common to see the two designs side by side. How to pay? The best way to save on commission is to pay by credit card . When paying by card, the exchange rate is current and the maximum fee, depending on the issuer of the card; is usually 1%. The easiest and usually cheapest option is to withdraw money once you get to your destination, but there are other options: The easiest option is to withdraw pounds directly from any ATM in London . This is also the cheapest option since it has a lower exchange rate. However, it is important to keep in mind that cash machine transactions abroad have several fees and your bank might charge you up to $5 each time you use a foreign ATM , so it is always a good idea to take out a substantial amount instead of having to go several times to an ATM and being charged a fee every time you take cash out. There are always those who prefer to change money before leaving home. For this, there are two options: you can do it in a bank, although the commissions are usually quite high (up to 10%), or do it with a specialized company. If you prefer to exchange money once you get to London, you can do so in any bank or any bureau de change. We recommend you compare the exchange rate and the commission since it can differ from one place to another or else simply ask how many pounds you will get. £ 1 ( US$ 1.34) Despite excessive transportation and accommodation costs, London has significant advantages for tourists as most museums are free.

If it has been for a while, you may be surprised that the city with the best “Fish and Chips” in the world has gone a lot of changes. Did you use shillings back then? How about sovereigns? Before flying out to another country, you should take some time to research on how you pay for purchases over there. The last thing you want is to be in a situation in a strange land where you are about to make a purchase and have no means of paying for it. We’ve taken the guesswork out for you by writing this guide on London’s currency . Sit back, have a cup of coffee, and take a quick read through our guide before finalizing your plans to visit London. First things first, learn the lingo of British currency: Britain is notorious for creating lots of slang terms for their money denominations. The names can be very tricky! Here are some of the common phrases used: The official money presently circulating in London is the Great British Pound which has GBP as its currency code. You may often hear the term “Pound Sterling” quoted for the GBP. To avoid confusion, most people just refer to it as The Pound. It may be a bit inconvenient carrying around Pounds in London. The currency literally “adds pounds” to your wallet but not in a good way. When exchanging for Pounds, you won’t receive a lot of paper bills. It is denominated mostly in coins. Make sure to wear suspenders or cinch your belt tighter. Speaking of exchanging for Pounds, if you wish to do so, you can use the money changing services at the airport, the local banks and post office. You may even exchange currency at the train station. Before exchanging currency, check the daily reference rates quoted on broadsheets or on online websites. Stay informed to get maximum value for your money. Also, take the time to cross reference the rates offered at the money changing service centres. If you’re a bit confused about the moneys used in Great Britain, England, and the United Kingdom or UK, you are not alone! Many people often get confused about which money is used where. Let us clear the air. The UK is composed of England, Wales, and Scotland. So the currency in Wales will be the same as all of the rest of the countries within GB. These countries all have the Pound as its official money. Meanwhile, Great Britain which covers southern Ireland and the other countries we previously mentioned, also observes the Pound as its official currency. However, Southern Ireland is located outside Great Britain and thus has the Euro as its medium of exchange. In 2016, the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union or EU. The event is referred to as “Brexit”. London’s departure from the EU is planned to take effect in 2019. The EU’s official money is the euro. Even when the UK was part of the EU, the Euro never became the country’s official money. You will still find st",

      "text": "Home » Symbols » Currencies The currency of England is the pound sterling. Every pound is subdivided into 100 pennies. This currency is really the currency of the United Kingdom, and not just of England, of which England is a member country. Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland use the same pounds. The pound sterling is one of the most internationally traded currencies in the world. The word “sterling” refers to the currency as a whole, whereas the “pound” is a unit of account along with the penny. It is issued by the Bank of England and is most commonly referred to as a “quid” in English slang . Let’s find out more. In This Article The currency of England, and indeed of the whole United Kingdom, is the pound sterling. The pound is the primary unit of sterling, so the sterling is the name of the currency more generally. It is the world’s oldest currency that is still in use, with bank notes having been issued by the Bank of England for more than 300 years. The first pound coin was minted under Henry VII in 1489. It is the fourth most traded currency in the world today, after the US dollar, euro and the Japanese Yen. It is one of the basket of currencies, then, which calculates the value of the special drawing rights of the IMF. The Bank of England is the central bank of the United Kingdom and is responsible for issuing of all notes and coins in England. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, they regulate the issuing of currency by private banks. So, in Northern Ireland and Scotland, you will find banknotes and coins that are different, but they are the same currency. In Wales, all banknotes are issued by the Bank of England and no private banks issue their own denominations. No one is quite sure where the term “sterling” comes from, though there are a few theories. The OED states that the most likely explanation is that it comes from the Old English word steorra meaning star, with the “ling” suffix to create “little star”. In Norman England, silver pennies bearing a small star were in wide circulation. Many different slang terms have been used for sterling over time, though the most common one by a long way today is “quid”. This is used just about everywhere in the country. You may also hear them referred to as “bob”, though this is more archaic. The pound and the sterling are the same thing. In general everyday conversation, though, you are very unlikely to ever hear a British person refer to them as sterling. Unless a slang term is used, the term “pound” is always going to be what is used. However, the distinction is that the pound is the individual unit of the currency, and the sterling is the name of the currency more generally. So, each pound is split into one hundred pennies.",
