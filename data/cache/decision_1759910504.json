Nearly all of the world's countries participated, with many nations mobilising all resources in pursuit of total war . Tanks and aircraft played major roles , enabling the strategic bombing of cities and delivery of the first and only nuclear weapons ever used in war. World War II is the deadliest conflict in history, causing the death of 70 to 85 million people , more than half of whom were civilians. Millions died in genocides , including the Holocaust , and by massacres, starvation, and disease. After the Allied victory, Germany , Austria , Japan , and Korea were occupied, and German and Japanese leaders were tried for war crimes . The causes of World War II included unresolved tensions in the aftermath of World War I , the rise of fascism in Europe and militarism in Japan . Key events preceding the war included Japan's invasion of Manchuria in 1931, the Spanish Civil War , the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, and Germany's annexations of Austria and the Sudetenland . World War II is generally considered to have begun on 1 September 1939, when Nazi Germany , under Adolf Hitler , invaded Poland , after which the United Kingdom and France declared war on Germany. Poland was divided between Germany and the Soviet Union under the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact . In 1940, the Soviet Union annexed the Baltic states and parts of Finland and Romania . After the fall of France in June 1940, the war continued mainly between Germany and the British Empire , with fighting in the Balkans , Mediterranean, and Middle East , the aerial Battle of Britain and the Blitz , and the naval Battle of the Atlantic . Through campaigns and treaties, Germany gained control of much of continental Europe and formed the Axis alliance with Italy , Japan , and other countries. In June 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union , opening the Eastern Front and initially making large territorial gains. In December 1941, Japan attacked American and British territories in Asia and the Pacific , including at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii , leading the United States to enter the war against Japan and Germany . Japan conquered much of coastal China and Southeast Asia , but its advances in the Pacific were halted in June 1942 at the Battle of Midway . In early 1943, Axis forces were defeated in North Africa and at Stalingrad in the Soviet Union, and that year their continued defeats on the Eastern Front, an Allied invasion of Italy , and Allied offensives in the Pacific forced them into retreat on all fronts. In 1944, the Western Allies invaded France at Normandy , as the Soviet Union recaptured its pre-war territory and the US crippled Japan's navy and captured key Pacific islands .

      "text": "There are three dates for the conflict's end, with a separate date for Russia Bettmann/Contributor/Getty Images When did WWII end? With the unconditional surrender of Germany in May 1945 the battle was over, but both May 8 and May 9 are celebrated as Victory in Europe Day (or V-E Day). This double celebration occurs because the Germans surrendered to the Western Allies, including Britain and the U.S., on May 8, and a separate surrender took place on May 9 in Russia. In the East, the war ended when Japan surrendered unconditionally on Aug. 14, 1945, signing their surrender on Sept. 2. The Japanese surrender occurred after the United States dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki on Aug. 6 and 9, respectively. The date of the Japanese surrender is known as Victory Over Japan Day, or V-J Day. Within two years after starting the war in Europe with his invasion of Poland in 1939 , Adolf Hitler (1889–1945) had subjugated much of the continent, including France after a lightning-fast conquest. Then Der Führer sealed his fate with a poorly thought-out invasion of the Soviet Union. Joseph Stalin (1878–1953) and the Soviet people did not concede, although they had to overcome initial defeats. Soon, however, the overextended Nazi forces were defeated at Stalingrad and the Soviets began to force them slowly back across Europe. It took a long time and millions of deaths, but the Soviets eventually pushed Hitler's forces all the way back to Germany. In 1944, a new front was reopened in the West when Britain, France, the U.S., Canada, and other allies landed in Normandy . Two enormous military forces, approaching from the east and the west, eventually wore the Nazis down. In Berlin, the Soviet forces were fighting their way through the German capital. Hitler, once the charismatic ruler of an empire, was reduced to hiding in a bunker, giving orders to forces that only existed in his head. The Soviets were getting close to the bunker, and on April 30, 1945, Hitler commited suicide. Command of the German forces passed to Admiral Karl Doenitz (1891–1980), and he quickly sent out peace feelers. He soon realized an unconditional surrender would be required, and he was ready to sign. But with the war over, the tenuous alliance between the U.S. and the Soviets was turning frosty, a new wrinkle which would eventually lead to the Cold War. While the Western Allies agreed to the surrender on May 8, the Soviets insisted on their own surrender ceremony and process. This took place on May 9, the official end to what the USSR called the Great Patriotic War. Victory and surrender would not come easily for the Allies in the Pacific Theater. The war in the Pacific had started with the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor in Hawaii on Dec. 7, 1941. After years of battles and unsuccessful attempts at negotiating a treaty, the United States dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in early Aug. 1945. A week later, on Aug. 15, Japan announced its intention to surrender. The",

      "text": "–submitted by Larry Larrabee; photo by Mike Engelberger Professor Stanley Payne presented on the topic “WWII: When Did It End?” at our meeting on Wednesday October 14, 2015. He is a professor emeritus of the University of Wisconsin Department of History and the author of several books on Europe and WWII, some of which have received national awards. In this week’s presentation, Dr. Payne began by explaining Winston Churchill’s belief that the victory over Germany did not end the equally real threat of the Soviet Union, which controlled half of Europe, upsetting the balance of power that Britain and other democracies needed to survive. In December 1944, Churchill launched “Operation Unthinkable” to push Russia out of Central Europe by force after the defeat of Germany. The Polish Government in Exile, with its 200,000 troops, and even a sizable portion of German POWs were willing to enter armed conflict with the USSR after V-E Day but the idea received no support from the US leaders, with the exception of General George Patton. And thus, a hot war turned into the Cold War. Since 1945, it has been an age of civil wars in Eastern and Central Europe, the Middle East and Asia including America entering those in Korea and Viet Nam. In fact, unusual for wars since the Middle Ages, there was no peace treaty in Potsdam following WWII. Thus, Churchill was correct. Victory over Germany did not really end the war. Although the later fall of the Soviet Union decreased that country as a single threat, the civil wars have continued, particularly in the Middle East. Did you miss our meeting this week?
