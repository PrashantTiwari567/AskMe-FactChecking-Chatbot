The role of the secretary-general and of the secretariat is laid out by Chapter XV (Articles 97 to 101) of the United Nations Charter . However, the office's qualifications, selection process and tenure are open to interpretation; they have been established by custom. [ 1 ] The secretary-general is appointed by the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council . As the recommendation must come from the Security Council, any of the five permanent members of the council can veto a nomination. Most secretaries-general are compromise candidates from middle powers and have little prior fame. Unofficial qualifications for the job have been set by precedent in previous selections. The appointee may not be a citizen of any of the Security Council's five permanent members. [ 2 ] The General Assembly resolution 51/241 in 1997 stated that, in the appointment of \"the best candidate\", due regard should be given to regional (continental) rotation of the appointee's national origin and to gender equality, [ 3 ] : 5 although no woman has yet served as secretary-general. All appointees to date have been career diplomats . [ 4 ] The length of the term is discretionary, but all secretaries-general since 1971 have been appointed to five-year terms. Every secretary-general since 1961 has been re-selected for a second term, with the exception of Boutros Boutros-Ghali , who was vetoed by the United States in the 1996 selection . While the position does not have a formal term limit , [ 5 ] incumbent secretary-generals have avoided seeking a third term since the 1981 selection , when China cast a record 16 vetoes against a third term for Kurt Waldheim . The selection process is opaque and is often compared to a papal conclave . [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Since 1981, the Security Council has voted in secret in a series of straw polls ; it then submits the winning candidate to the General Assembly for ratification. No candidate has ever been rejected by the General Assembly, and only once, in 1950 , has a candidate been voted upon despite a UNSC veto. [ 8 ] In 2016, the General Assembly and the Security Council sought nominations and conducted public debates for the first time. However, the Security Council voted in private and followed the same process as previous selections, leading the president of the General Assembly to complain that it \"does not live up to the expectations of the membership and the new standard of openness and transparency\". [ 9 ] The UN Charter designates the secretary-general as the \"chief administrative officer\" of the UN, and gives the secretary-general the power to make employment decisions about Secretariat staff. The Charter also empowers the secretary-general to inform the Security Council of \"any matter which in his o",

A member of the Portuguese Socialist Party , Guterres served as the prime minister of Portugal from 1995 to 2002. Guterres studied physics and electrical engineering at Lisbon ’s Instituto Superior Técnico , briefly taught systems theory and telecommunications , and became involved in politics while active in a Catholic youth group. Guterres served as secretary-general of the Socialist Party from 1992 to 2002. He was elected prime minister in 1995. He led the party to legislative victories in 1995 and 1999 . Guterres announced his resignation as Socialist Party leader in 2002 following the party’s losses in the 2001 local elections , with Eduardo Ferro Rodrigues succeeding him while he remained prime minister until losing the subsequent general election to José Manuel Barroso ’s Social Democratic Party . Despite this defeat, polling of the Portuguese public in both 2012 and 2014 ranked Guterres the best prime minister of the previous 30 years. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] He served as President of the Socialist International from 1999 to 2005. He was the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees from 2005 to 2015.

      "text": "Having witnessed the suffering of the most vulnerable people on earth, from refugee camps to war zones, the Secretary-General has centered his efforts on ensuring human dignity for all. In a period of unprecedented global challenges, he has drawn on his commitment to the UN Charter to mobilize people and launch action to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, address the climate emergency, advance gender equality, and achieve ambitious 21st century reforms to enhance the Organization’s vital efforts to secure peace, sustainable development, human rights and humanitarian aid. Prior to his appointment as Secretary-General, Mr. Guterres served as United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees from June 2005 to December 2015, heading one of the world’s foremost humanitarian organizations during some of the most serious displacement crises in decades. The conflicts in Syria and Iraq, and the crises in South Sudan, the Central African Republic and Yemen, led to a huge rise in UNHCR’s activities as the number of people displaced by conflict and persecution rose from 38 million in 2005 to over 60 million in 2015. Before joining UNHCR, Mr. Guterres spent more than 20 years in government and public service. He served as prime minister of Portugal from 1995 to 2002, during which time he was heavily involved in the international effort to resolve the crisis in East Timor. As president of the European Council in early 2000, he led the adoption of the Lisbon Agenda for growth and jobs, and co-chaired the first European Union-Africa summit. He was a member of the Portuguese Council of State from 1991 to 2002. Mr. Guterres was elected to the Portuguese Parliament in 1976 where he served as a member for 17 years. During that time, he chaired the Parliamentary Committee for Economy, Finance and Planning, and later the Parliamentary Committee for Territorial Administration, Municipalities and Environment. He was also leader of his party’s parliamentary group. From 1981 to 1983, Mr. Guterres was a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, where he chaired the Committee on Demography, Migration and Refugees. For many years Mr. Guterres was active in the Socialist International, a worldwide organization of social democratic political parties. He was the group’s vice-president from 1992 to 1999, co-chairing the African Committee and later the Development Committee. He served as President from 1999 until mid-2005. In addition, he founded the Portuguese Refugee Council as well as the Portuguese Consumers Association DECO, and served as president of the Centro de Acção Social Universitário, an association carrying out social development projects in poor neighbourhoods of Lisbon, in the early 1970s. Mr. Guterres is a member of the Club of Madrid, a leadership alliance of democratic former presidents and prime ministers from around the world. Mr. Guterres was born in Lisbon in 1949 and graduated from the Instituto Superior Técnico with a degree in engineering",

Leffingwell Lecture The United Nations’ first secretary-general, Trygve Lie, called it the most difficult job in the world. Some of the difficulty lies in the job description. Though U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, several years before the United Nations’ creation, saw the secretary-general’s role as that of a “world moderator,” the UN Charter formally defines the secretary-general as the body’s “chief administrative officer.” Each of the nine secretaries to date has tended to favor one of these two approaches to the role. The current secretary-general, former Portuguese Prime Minister António Guterres, has spent his two terms focused on advancing sustainable development, promoting peace and human rights, and reforming the UN system—all while facing a staggering range of crises, including worsening climate change, the COVID-19 pandemic, and wars in the Gaza Strip, Ukraine, and elsewhere. While all secretaries-general have confronted varying challenges, what appears to be constant is the ambiguous nature of the position itself—a role bifurcated between the tasks of “secretary” and “general,” often leaning more toward the former. More on: United Nations International Organizations Global Governance Diplomacy and International Institutions Beyond the role of chief administrative officer, the UN Charter leaves the secretary-general’s desired qualities, candidate selection process, and length of tenure open to interpretation.

The secretary-general is required to uphold the values of the United Nations, even at the risk of challenging member states. For example, when tensions escalated between Serbs and ethnic Albanians in Kosovo in 1999, Secretary-General Kofi Annan (1997–2006) famously said that “no government has the right to hide behind national sovereignty in order to violate human",
