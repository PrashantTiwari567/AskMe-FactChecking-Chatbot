      "text": "Ottawa sits in eastern Ontario at the confluence of the Ottawa and Rideau rivers, directly across from Gatineau, Québec. Together they form the Ottawa–Gatineau Census Metropolitan Area (CMA) and the legally defined National Capital Region (NCR). The city’s compact downtown clusters around Parliament Hill, while suburbs stretch along the Greenbelt and into both provinces. As of the 2021 Census, the City of Ottawa had 1,017,449 residents; the wider CMA registered 1,488,307, making it Canada’s fourth-largest metro area. These figures come from Statistics Canada and are the most comparable across cities; more recent 2024 estimates show continued growth, driven largely by immigration to major metropolitan areas. Downtown Ottawa lies near 45.4215° N, 75.6972° W at roughly 230 ft (70 m) above sea level. The city center is roughly 124 mi (200 km) from Montréal and about 280 mi (450 km) from Toronto by road. The Ottawa and Rideau waterways shaped the settlement, with the Rideau Canal linking the Ottawa River to Lake Ontario at Kingston. Before Ottawa, legislators shuttled between Kingston, Montréal, Toronto, and Québec City, sparking years of rivalry. In 1857, the Province of Canada asked Queen Victoria to choose a permanent seat. On 31 December 1857, she selected Ottawa—remote enough to be defensible (especially after the War of 1812), yet positioned between Canada West (Ontario) and Canada East (Québec), a political compromise between English and French Canada. Construction of Parliament Buildings began in 1859. By 1866, legislators held sessions in Ottawa’s new Centre, East, and West Blocks. One year later, on 1 July 1867, the Dominion of Canada was born, and Ottawa continued as the national capital. Local archives document how Bytown (founded 1826) became Ottawa (incorporated 1855) and how the decision was communicated by Colonial Secretary Henry Labouchere’s letter of 31 December 1857. City of Ottawa Archives (PDF) ; The choice balanced strategy and unity: Ottawa’s inland, cliff-top setting was easier to defend than border cities, and its location on the Ontario–Québec line symbolized a bilingual, bicultural state. Water routes via the Ottawa River and the Rideau Canal also linked it to Montréal and Kingston. Parliament Hill—overlooking the Ottawa River—is the symbolic heart of Canada’s democracy. The Hill houses the Senate and House of Commons in Gothic Revival buildings on landscaped grounds. It remains the site of national ceremonies, Canada Day events, and public gatherings, and it’s administered in part by the National Capital Commission (NCC). Ottawa also embodies Canada’s bilingual identity. While Canada’s official languages are English and French, the municipality has its own bilingualism by-law that guarantees city services in both languages, reaffirmed by provincial legislation. Street signs, transit information, and City Hall services are routinely available in English and French. Ottawa’s setting defines its look and lifestyle. The Rideau",

Permanent settlement on the south bank of the river did not occur until the following decade, when, during the War of 1812 between Britain and the United States, it became apparent that the St. Lawrence River between Montreal and Kingston, Ontario, was vulnerable to attack as both a military and an economic target. The British proposed turning the Rideau River into a canal to serve as an alternate shipping and transportation route, diverting traffic up the Ottawa River to Chaudière Falls and back down to Kingston. Lieut. Col. John By of the Royal Engineers was in charge of constructing the more than 126-mile- (203-km-) long canal (1826–32). He also surveyed and laid out a town site on the south bank as a place of residence for his workers and himself; that village became known as Bytown. It was incorporated as a town in 1850 and as the city of Ottawa in 1855. Britannica Quiz Capital Cities by Continent Quiz, Easier Edition The Rideau Canal was never used as a military route, but its importance in the transportation of timbers, goods, and people was the main factor in the city ’s early growth, especially during the period of high U.S. demand for forest products that lasted through the 1800s. Political unrest within Britain’s Canadian colonies (including armed rebellion in 1837) resulted in Britain’s unification of the separate colonies of Upper and Lower Canada into one province, the Province of Canada (1841). When it came time to designate a capital for united Canada , however, political quarrels between rival cities, such as between Quebec city and Toronto and between Montreal and Kingston, induced leaders to call upon Queen Victoria to settle the question. The queen selected Ottawa in late 1857. Although Ottawa was a strong candidate because of its location and its accessibility by rail, the choice still surprised many, given the city ’s relatively small size and its identification primarily with the processing and distribution of lumber. When the Dominion of Canada was formed a decade later, Ottawa remained the capital , and it continued to grow as a major administrative centre. A large portion of Ottawa was razed by a fire in 1900 that destroyed Hull, and in 1916 another fire consumed most of the Parliament Buildings. Reconstruction began soon afterward, and the Centre Block was completed in 1922. The growth of civil service jobs was slow but expanded in response to events such as World War I, the institution of an income tax, the Great Depression of the 1930s, and World War II. Still, the capital city , to all appearances, remained an industrial pulp and paper mill town, with smokestacks and railways dominating the waterfront.

In this guide, we'll answer an important question everyone should know the answer to: what is the capital of Canada? In addition, we'll explain how this place came to be the capital city of Canada and what all the capital cities of the Canadian provinces and territories are currently. The capital of Canada is Ottawa, which is located in Ontario —that is, the province directly above the Great Lakes and the US states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, and (part of) New York. Ottawa lies on the south bank of the Ottawa River, which runs between and defines the borders of the provinces Ontario and Quebec. Opus Penguin /Flickr Together, Ottawa and the city of Gatineau, which is located directly across from Ottawa in Quebec, make up the National Capital Region called Ottawa-Gatineau. This specially designated region refers to not only the cities themselves but also their surrounding Census Metropolitan Areas. Due to Ottawa’s placement between the primarily English-speaking Ontario and the mostly French-speaking Quebec, it is one of the most bilingual cities in Canada. Below are some quick facts to know about Ottawa, the capital city of Canada: Ottawa has been the capital city of Canada ever since Canada became a self-governing country. But how exactly did it manage to become the capital of Canada — and why? In 1841, what was originally called the Province of Canada (the present-day provinces of Ontario and Quebec) came under British colonial control. The next 16 years witnessed ongoing disputes over what the capital of the new province should be; contenders included Quebec City, Toronto, Montreal, Kingston, and finally Ottawa. Each of these cities held the title of capital of Canada for varying lengths of time. Here is a chronology of exactly how the capital city of Canada changed in just two and a half decades: It was clear already by 1857 that the decision of where to place the capital of Canada was going to be difficult and time-consuming. At this time, Queen Victoria was asked to select the capital city of Canada. Her choice of Ottawa — a fairly small and newly incorporated city — surprised many. Still, Ottawa had a lot of promise: it was starting to experience economic growth and was home to an impressive railway system; it also had a long history of trade due to its location near several rivers. But not everyone agreed with the queen’s pick, which led Toronto to remain the capital for another two years followed by Quebec City for another six years. It wasn’t until 1866 that Ottawa was officially designated the capital city of the Province of Canada and began to hold Parliament. In 1867, the Province of Canada became the Dominion of Canada, making it an official, self-governing colony of the British empire. This also meant that Ottawa was the first (and so far only) official capital of",
